    <h2><a href="http://blog.xivo.io/sccpp-and-continuous-integration.html#sccpp-and-continuous-integration">SCCPp and continuous integration</a></h2>
    <p>
      Posted on Mon 20 February 2012 in <a href="http://blog.xivo.io/category/software.html">Software</a>

      <p>SCCPp is a small tool that we developed in parallel of our Asterisk sccp
channel. Its main purpose is to imitate a real cisco phone in a pure
virtual way. One of the main goal behind it is to be able to do
continuous integration. By coupling SCCPp with Asterisk testsuite and
Jenkins we are able to automate tests that we would normally do
manually. This way, when a commit is pushed, it trigger a task that
launch the script responsible to update and compile the source, to pass
every test in the list and to report if something went wrong.</p>
<p>Only basic test are implemented via SCCPp at the present moment. We can
simulate the full protocol exchange involved when a phone connect and
authenticate itself to the server. Another supported option is the
stress test of a configured device. In this mode, SCCPp start two
threads and dial the device at random interval. The goal here is to pass
through as much code as possible and to make sure there is no regression
in the code under known scenarios.</p>
<p>SCCPp doesn't support the RTP protocol (Real-Time Transport Protocol) at
the present moment. What it mean is that we can't simulate the
transportation of the voice from a device to another. The development of
SCCPp is still at an early stage, and many more features will be added
in the future.</p>
<p>As the complexity of the libsccp increase, we need more tests to ensure
that a change in the code, such a bug fix, do not introduce new faults.
Functional testing is only one part of the solution, even if it's a
powerful one to ensure that specific cases work well, it says nothing
about the internal. The other half of the solution is to unit test the
code. This is a method by which individual units of source code are
tested to ensure they perform properly. Fortunately, Asterisk has its
own framework that allow us to easily write unit test and to trigger
them to see if they pass correctly. In another post, we will present
what can be done with this Asterisk unit test framework and how it can
help to do TDD (Test Driven Development).</p>
<p>If you are interested to play with SCCPp, you can get the source code at
this address:

    <h2><a href="http://blog.xivo.io/xivo-12.html#xivo-12">XiVO 1.2</a></h2>
    <p>
      Posted on Tue 14 February 2012 in <a href="http://blog.xivo.io/category/articles.html">articles</a>

      <p>As we enter 2012, we continue our development to better meet market
expectations allowing XiVO to be deployed in more companies. XiVO is a
real open and free alternative for your business phone system and it
will allow you to go even further. It is with great pleasure that I
announce the arrival of this new major release of XiVO which is also our
last considering that our development model is replaced by the agile
methodology (SCRUM).</p>
<p>Why do we change ?</p>
<p>Just because we want to be closer to your requests, be able to stand
out, constantly innovate and for this we need a new vision of
development. It's been several months since we changed our habits, our
ways of building software, our vision of what a software is and we will
continue in that direction. We still have a long way to go but it only
makes XiVO better for everyone.</p>
<p><img alt="xivo-web-1-2.png" src="/public/.xivo-web-1-2_m.jpg" title="xivo-web-1-2.png, fév. 2012" /></p>
<p>In this new release we have upgraded the operating system from Lenny to
Squeeze, updated Asterisk by installing and using the last “Long Term
Supported” 1.8 version. These major changes are not only naturally
bringing us a bunch of new native functionalities but also better
performance and stability.</p>
<p>Regarding XiVO, we reviewed our provisioning server which was designed
at the beginning of XiVO and was not suited any more to the big
architectures we are targeting.</p>
<p>We have refreshed the web interface in terms of functionality and
ergonomics to meet the new functionalities provided by Asterisk. We also
changed the way configuration is done by using a new server dedicated to
configuration management.</p>
<p>The news also made us realize that we were not sure where we go with
mysql and we chose to use Postgres as a basis to save our
configurations.TDM card drivers are also updated when this new release
is installed.</p>
<p>CTI server and XiVO client were also mainly rewritten and refactored.</p>
<p>With this new release we also started to work on refactoring some
features which are not delivered now any more. At first, high
availability and contact center are our current priorities and will be
offered in the next coming releases.Our development method is based on
short iterations of 2 weeks, which will produce a finished and working
product. So every 2 weeks a new release is produced and you will be able
to upgrade and enjoy bug fixes and new features. Do not hesitate to
follow http://projects.xivo.fr and http://documentation.xivo.fr/ to get
a better view.</p>
<p>We will go through our process in more details in a later post to
describe what we have set up in term of tests, documentation, bug
tracking etc ....</p>
<p>Below what's new in this release at a glance :</p>
<ul>
<li>Asterisk 1.8 (New options, SSL authentication, etc ...)</li>

    <p>
      Posted on Thu 09 February 2012 in <a href="http://blog.xivo.io/category/software.html">Software</a>
      &#8226; Tagged with
      <a href="http://blog.xivo.io/tag/xivo-12.html">xivo 1.2</a>,      <a href="http://blog.xivo.io/tag/provisioning.html">provisioning</a>    </p>
  </header>
  <div>
      <p>Well. Yes. provd ask a "device info extractor" object to extract
information from the HTTP request, and that object returns the
information we were expecting. But what is really happening inside that
"device info extractor" ? Let's see:</p>
<p><a href="/public/provd/provd-dev-info-extraction-details.png" title="Device info extraction details"><img alt="Device info extraction
details" src="/public/provd/.provd-dev-info-extraction-details_m.jpg" title="Device info extraction details, fév. 2012" /></a></p>
<p>The device info extractor object is in fact only merging results from
two others device info extractor.</p>
<p>The "all plugins device info extractor" ask for each installed plugin to
extract info from the request. In this case, thexivo-aastra plugin is of
course able to extract a lot of information by looking at the User-Agent
header, but the xivo-cisco-sccp plugin is of no help. The results are
then merged and returned.</p>
<p>The "standard device info extractor" extract the IP address. It's role
is to only extract trivial information from requests.</p>
<p>From what we learned, we can deduce some properties of device
information extraction in provd.</p>
<p>First, if no plugins are installed, only IP addresses will ever be
extracted.</p>
<p>Next, we can ask ourselves what happens when two plugins returns
different information. Well, the "all plugins device info extractor" is
capable of applying different merge strategies. I won't go into more
details for now.</p>
<p>The last thing we can see is that a bad plugin could make the system
unreliable. You do not want to be in the situation were wrong
information is extracted by a plugin. That is why it's always safer to
only install the plugins you need, and no more.</p>
<p>Now that we know all that, let's see what happens for a request coming
from a Cisco 7940. One of the first request it does is:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>TFTP RRQ SEP554433221100.cnf.xml
</pre></div>


<p>TFTP requests are really simple, especially if you compare them to HTTP
requests. The only interesting information an RRQ (read request) can
have is the filename. But a filename can contains a lot of information.</p>
<p>TFTP requests take a similar flow as HTTP requests in provd. In our
example, the xivo-aastra plugin will return no information from it, but
the xivo-cisco-sccp plugin will be able to extract both the vendor and
the MAC address. For this request, it's not possible to determine the
model nor the firmware version.</p>
<p>So provd knows the request came from a Cisco, and that its MAC address
is 55:44:33:22:11:00. That's not much, but it's better than nothing.</p>
<p>That said, there is a special trick for extracting information about the
model on Cisco 7900 phones. I won't tell you what it is because I'm
getting tired of writing this article, but all I can say is that it's
pretty neat, and it's also useful in some other situation. Well okay,
I'll just say the name: DHCP integration.</p>
<p>That's all folks. We have both seen the best (Aastra 6731i) and the
worst (Cisco 7940) case concerning device info extraction in provd. That
said, even the worst case doesn't pose a real problem. Next time, if I
don't get too many death threat following this article, I'll talk about
the next step of request processing in provd, device retrieving, which
is quite simpler by the way.</p>

    <h2><a href="http://blog.xivo.io/xivo-documentation-project.html#xivo-documentation-project">XiVO Documentation Project</a></h2>
    <p>
      Posted on Wed 01 February 2012 in <a href="http://blog.xivo.io/category/software.html">Software</a>

  <div>
      <p>Documentation is often a touchy subject on many projects, and for XiVO
in this respect, it is also an important matter.</p>
<p>Retrospective, over retrospective, documentation organization and tools
comes often to the surface. Maybe some of you already noticed that XiVO
development cycle has changed and that we are now producing a release
every two weeks. In fact we started to use SCRUM six months ago, and in
this respect, we do not forget to do our 'inspect and adapt' meeting,
not so many often as we should but this is an other story !</p>
<p>Anyway, XiVO documentation is currently done using a
<a href="http://wiki.xivo.fr" title="wiki">wiki</a>, but this wiki is hard to maintain
and to structure, information is also difficult to find. We tried also
to use other type of wikis, but nothing was very satisfying.</p>
<p>We looked over some other projects, to check how the documentation was
done, and it comes to us that some of them are using
<a href="http://sphinx.pocoo.org/" title="sphinx">sphinx</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“a tool that makes it easy to create intelligent and beautiful
documentation, written by Georg Brandl and licensed under the BSD
license”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the item of our <em>Definition of Done</em> is documentation, it has to
be done by the development team. It is so natural to us to edit
restructured text, using GIT to push modification to a repository that
all the team was enthusiast to use these tools for improving XiVO
documentation. It was also an opportunity for us to try to use an
external Git repository, we chose
<a href="https://gitorious.org/xivo-doc" title="Gitorious">Gitorious</a> to start with
XiVO documentation project. This is also a way to open it to a larger
community.</p>
<p>Do not hesitate to clone the project and submit documentation patches
!!!</p>
<p>Last but not least, documentation production is now integrated in our
tool chain, using <a href="http://jenkins.xivo.fr" title="jenkins">jenkins</a> as
integration server, files are pulled from Gitorious automatically to
produce the <a href="http://documentation.xivo.fr" title="XiVO documentation site">XiVO documentation
site</a></p>
<p>You will find how to contribute
<a href="http://documentation.xivo.fr/developers/contributes/index.html" title="here">here</a>
Have fun !!</p>

      <p>For months now, we have had our continuous integration tool
<a href="http://jenkins.xivo.fr/" title="Jenkins">Jenkins</a> running automatic tests to
detect regression bugs on the XiVO web interface. But the web interface
is not the only interface XiVO offers ; there is a XiVO Client, running
as a stand-alone Qt application on other machines.</p>
<p>Until now, we were running tests on the XiVO Client by hand at the end
of each development iteration. Well, we will still run some of them by
hand for a time, but we now can make most of them run automatically. We
just have to code the tests :-)</p>
<p>Here's what a Lettuce test look like :  </p>

</pre></div>


<p>Let's get a bit more technical to explain how this works.The main
problem was to make our
<a href="http://lettuce.it/" title="Lettuce/Selenium">Lettuce/Selenium</a> automatic
tests in Python communicate with a running instance of the XiVO Client
in C++.</p>
<p>Our first attempt got us to embed the XiVO Client in a C++ library, to
wrap this library into a Python module with
<a href="SWIG" title="http://www.swig.org/">SWIG</a>, load this module when running
automatic tests and call some module functions to make the XiVO Client
do what we wanted, for example click on this button or fill that text
field. Of course, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friend_class" title="C++ classes friendship">C++ classes
friendship</a>
was mandarory to avoid coding getters and setters everywhere. We got the
XiVO Client running within a Python module, but it was blocking the
execution of automatic tests. We then tried to make the XiVO Client run
in its own thread, while automatic tests were running in another.
Unfortunately, the Qt library we use to develop the XiVO Client does not
support running in a secondary thread as far as GUI is involved (and the
XiVO Client is almost only about GUI).</p>
<p>Our second attempt was greatly inspired from the first one, but we tried
to run the XiVO Client in its own process. We replaced calls to the
Python module by an IPC protocol through local domain UNIX sockets.
Basically, the Lettuce process sends the name of the function it is
executing along with its arguments and the XiVO Client reads them,
execute the given function and returns whether the function failed or
succeeded.</p>
<p>This is no more no less than the behavior of a remote control for the
XiVO Client. It does not have many buttons for now, but they are
functional and their number is growing.</p>
<p><a href="/public/xivosoft/xivoclient-remotecontrol.png" title="XiVO Client remote control"><img alt="XiVO Client remote
control" src="/public/xivosoft/.xivoclient-remotecontrol_m.jpg" title="XiVO Client remote control, janv. 2012" /></a></p>
<p>Of course this remote control "feature" is not released with official
XiVO Client versions. It is only activated when the XiVO Client is
compiled specifically for automatic tests.</p>
<p>For now, we only test the GNU/Linux version of the XiVO Client, even
though it is not the most used version. Ideally, we shoud test all
platform versions. But unless we stumble upon major differences between
different platform versions, we can rely on the <a href="http://qt.nokia.com/" title="Qt framework">Qt
framework</a> quality and its platform
abstraction features.</p>
