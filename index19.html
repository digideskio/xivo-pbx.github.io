  <div>
      <p>Last September we started to change our development methodology to use
SCRUM.</p>
<p>The main objective was to be able to deliver very quickly new XiVO
versions.Our sprints are two weeks long, and at the end of a sprint we
deliver a new release of XiVO that you can use by using the new
<em>xivo-upgrade</em> tool.Every two weeks on Monday we start with the planning
meeting, where we define what will be done during the sprint. Each bug
or task is written on a post it and put on our white board.</p>
<p>Every day, at 09h00 we do our daily Scrum, small stand up meeting where
all the team members answer the three scum traditional questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What did I do since yesterday?</li>
<li>What am I planning to do today?</li>
<li>Anything blocks me ?</li>
</ul>
<p>Optionally at the end of the stand up meeting, we can start a small
technical session about software architecture, code review and now that
we moved to a bigger office, we can draw on the walls and do design
review.</p>
<p>At the middle of the second week, on Wednesday we stop our development,
finish our commits, and build the release. At this time starts the
functional testing period. Today we run more than 350 functional tests
which are described in our test manager
<a href="http://testlink.xivo.fr" title="testlink">testlink</a>. These tests are partly
automated, and one of our goal is to be able to automate more and more
tests. Furthermore, every day some of our functional tests are run
automatically using our continuous integration server
<a href="http://jenkins.xivo.fr/" title="jenkins"></a> in addition to the unit tests
covering part of XiVO software.Once the tests are ok, the delivery check
list helps us to not forget anything to be sure you will be able to
xivo-upgrade your installation without any pain.</p>
<p>Last but not least, we do our sprint retrospective to be able to find
ways to improve our process. At the end, it's time for beer !</p>
<p>Today the main point is to be able to improve XiVO strength, and to
correct and deliver very quickly any problems you may have. New features
will come the second part of 2012 once this objective will be achieved.</p>
<p>It is very encouraging to see that in 2009 it took us on average <strong>315</strong>
days to close an issue, in 2010, 295 days, in 2011, 127 days, and <strong>this
year it takes only 28 days</strong> in average to close an open issue. This is
not finish we still have a long road, but thanks to the great team
working on XiVO, things improve every day.</p>
<p>So stay tune, every two weeks you will get a new flavor of XiVO, more
and more reliable and with hopefully more and more features.</p>
<p>If you'd like to participate in this adventure do not hesitate to
contact us,<a href="http://www.avencall.com/index.php?option=com_neorecruit&amp;Itemid=15&amp;lang=en">we are looking for passionate
people</a>.</p>

      Posted on Thu 12 April 2012 in <a href="http://blog.xivo.io/category/software.html">Software</a>
    </p>
  </header>
  <div>
      <p>Let's take the same example as we did last time, i.e. let's say we have
a xivo-aastra plugin installed.</p>
<p>So we plug a brand new Aastra 6731i on our network. The phone then does
the following HTTP request:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nf">GET</span> <span class="nn">/Aastra/aastra.cfg</span> <span class="kr">HTTP</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1.1</span>
<span class="na">User-Agent</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="l">Aastra6731i MAC:00-11-22-33-44-55 V:3.2.2.1136-SIP</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The "device info extraction" step is then able to extract the following
information:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>{&#39;vendor&#39;: &#39;Aastra&#39;, &#39;model&#39;: &#39;6731i&#39;, &#39;version&#39;: &#39;3.2.2.1136&#39;,
 &#39;mac&#39;: &#39;00:11:22:33:44:55&#39;, &#39;ip&#39;: &#39;192.168.1.100&#39;}
</pre></div>


<p>This information is then passed to a "device retriever" object. Here's a
pseudo code version of what it looks like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>def process_request(request):
    device_info = device_info_extractor.extract(request)
    device = device_retriever.retrieve(device_info)
    ...
</pre></div>


<p>A device object can be seen as a superset of a device info object. Both
are dictionaries, but the device object can contain keys that the device
infoobject never will, like an "id", a "plugin" and a "config" key.</p>
<p>Let's see in more details what happens in this "device retriever"
object:</p>
<p><a href="/public/provd/device-retriever.png" title="Device retriever"><img alt="Device
retriever" src="/public/provd/.device-retriever_m.jpg" title="Device retriever, avr. 2012" /></a></p>
<p>The device retriever will ask one at a time the different other device
retrievers until one returns something. In our example, since the provd
serverdoesn't know yet about our Aastra, the "mac device retriever" will
returns nothing because there is no device with the MAC address
00:11:22:33:44:55 in the device database, then the "SN (serial number)
device retriever" will returns nothing because no SN is used with
Aastra, then the "ip device retriever" will also returns nothing, and
finally, the "add device retriever" will add the new device to the
database and return it.</p>
<p>On the next requests of our Aastra, the "mac device retriever" will
search for a device with the given MAC and will then return the device
object that was added previously.</p>
<p>From what we just learned, we can see that it's at this step that
devices are automatically added to provd. That said, the automatic
plugin association and automatic config association (taken from a
"template" config) is not done at this step but later on, which is
something we'll see in more details in my next blog post.</p>
<p>If provd had to support only Aastra phones, only the "mac device
retriever" and the "add device retriever" would be needed (and some part
of provd would be a whole lot simpler also). That said, the reality is
more complex. Some phones are only doing TFTP requests, which means no
User-Agent header and little information to extract for some requests,
sometimes only the IP address. This is where the "ip device retriever"
comes in handy. It's usually able to find the right device by only using
the IP address. This is possible because provd always try to maintain
the most up to date info about IP address used by devices.</p>
<p>That said, for some devices, there is some scenarios where the system
just isn't powerful enough:</p>
<ul>
<li>you power on a new Linksys/Cisco SPA3102, which is given the
    192.168.1.101 IP address by the DHCP server</li>
<li>the phone then ask the /spa3102.cfg file via TFTP</li>
<li>provd knows the request came from a Linksys SPA3102 with the
    192.168.1.101 IP address, but doesn't know the MAC address. No
    worry, it still adds it to the device database.</li>
<li>the phone then ask the /001122334477.xml file, still via TFTP.</li>
<li>provd is able to retrieve the device by using the IP address, and
    now knows that the device behind the request has the MAC
    00:11:22:33:44:77</li>
<li>the phone is unplugged from the network</li>
<li>a couple of days later, the phone is power on again. This time, the
    DHCP server gives it the 192.168.1.102 IP address</li>
<li>the phone then ask the /spa3102.cfg file via TFTP</li>
<li>the only information that can used to retrieve the device is the
    IP address. That said, no device in the device database use this
    IP address. provd will then create a new device, believing its a
    new device.</li>
<li>the phone then ask the /001122334477.xml file</li>
<li>provd is then able to retrieve the first device by using the
    MAC address. It then updates the IP address information of
    this device. Unfortunately, the previous step created a device in
    the database for nothing.</li>
</ul>
<p>The system still works in these cases. The only problem is that you get
junk devices in provd device's database, and these can only be removed
manually. They are not causing any real harm except then adding some
confusion as to why theses devices are in the database.</p>
<p>There is a way to get by this problem, and it's called "dhcp
integration". Yes. Just believe me.</p>
<p>So that's all folks. Next time, if your brain still hasn't suffered from
an epileptic seizure, get ready because we'll be talking about the
"device updating" step.</p>

    <p>
      Posted on Wed 04 April 2012 in <a href="http://blog.xivo.io/category/software.html">Software</a>
    </p>
  </header>
  <div>
      <p>Until now, the XiVO Client was released for only two different
platforms : Windows, Debian GNU/Linux and Ubuntu. Yes, that makes three,
but Ubuntu is based upon Debian, and the two versions do not differ.</p>
<p>However, the Qt framework that is used by the XiVO Client allows
applications to be also built for Mac OS. Furthermore, back in the 1.1
version, the XiVO Client was supported on Mac OS. We then reused the old
building script that were rotting in our Git repository and cleaned them
up to allow us to build a new Mac version of the XiVO Client.</p>
<p>Here's what it looks like :</p>
<p><a href="/public/xivosoft/xivoclient-macos.png" title="XiVO Client Mac OS"><img alt="XiVO Client Mac
OS" src="/public/xivosoft/.xivoclient-macos_m.jpg" title="XiVO Client Mac OS, avr. 2012" /></a></p>
<p>The stable version will be released at the same time as other platforms,
by the end of the week, with the XiVO 1.2.5 release.</p>
<p>For hackers who would want to play around with the XiVO Client's source
code on Mac OS (or other platforms), the instructions for building and
coding can be found here :
http://documentation.xivo.fr/dev/developers/xivo_client/xivo_client.html</p>
<p>Another big news, even though Archers are (unfortunately ;) ) a bit
fewer than Mac users, the XiVO Client package for Archlinux on the AUR
is also being restored, and will soon be available in the AUR. The two
packages already here have not been updated since last year.</p>

    <p>
      Posted on Thu 29 March 2012 in <a href="http://blog.xivo.io/category/software.html">Software</a>
    </p>
  </header>
  <div>
      <p>In XiVO version 1.2.2, a new package has been introduced, xivo-upgrade.
This new script must be usedto make sure that upgrades are completed
properly. The objective is to minimize differences between machinesand
to control the environment in case of problems.</p>
<p>We had many problems to work around:</p>
<ul>
<li>questions to answer about replacing packaged files that have been
    modified</li>
<li>reload services when libraries are modified</li>
<li>modify the database schema when needed</li>
<li>showing the current and new version when upgrading</li>
</ul>
<p>We decided to put this system in place to keep upgrades simples and
transparent to the end ~~user~~ admin.The goal being to stay as SIMPLE
as possible!</p>
<p>Too many people are stressed by their IPBX upgrades!<img alt="Stress
Man" src="/public/human_pro/.file0001382919230_s.jpg" title="Stress Man, mar. 2012" /></p>
<p>But not with
XiVO!<img alt="Congratulation" src="/public/human_pro/.file6741271974648_s.jpg" title="Congratulation, mar. 2012" /></p>
<p>No one should be afraid of the side effects of an upgrade!</p>
<h2>Technical informations</h2>
<p>This package allows the administrator to upgrade his XiVO securely and
in a way validated by the dev team.The script executes many steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>xivo-upgrade upgrade, to get the latest modifications to the upgrade
    process</li>
<li>
<p>Upgrade confirmation if upgrades are available:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the answer is NO, the upgrade is aborted</li>
<li>If the answer is YES, the script continues to the next step</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pre-upgrade scripts are run.</p>
</li>
<li>XiVO is upgraded</li>
<li>Post-upgrade scripts are executed.</li>
<li>All XiVO services are restarted in the right order.</li>
</ol>
<p>Package architecture:</p>
<p>Binaries:</p>
<ul>
<li>xivo-upgrade (Update xivo-upgrade package and
    execute real-xivo-upgrade)</li>
<li>real-xivo-upgrade (Execute upgrade of XiVO and restart services)</li>
</ul>
<p>Libraries path: /usr/share/xivo-upgrade/</p>
<p>Directories:</p>
<ul>
<li>pre-upgrade.d (All files in this directory will be executed before
    upgrading XiVO)</li>
<li>post-upgrade.d (All files in this directory will be executed after
    XiVO upgrade)</li>
</ul>
<p>Current post-install scripts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Update template for device configuration.</li>
<li>Update all device configurations to integrate the backup_proxy_ip
    from the HA configuration.</li>
<li>Set default web-interface language to english.</li>
</ul>

    <h2><a href="http://blog.xivo.io/xivo-high-availability.html#xivo-high-availability">XiVO high availability</a></h2>
    <p>
      Posted on Wed 14 March 2012 in <a href="http://blog.xivo.io/category/articles.html">articles</a>
    </p>
  </header>
  <div>
      <p>High availability is available in XiVO since version 1.2.3. The current
use cases is to be able to get telephony service back in less than 5
minutes in case of a network or power failure on the master XiVO.</p>
<p>The architecture is pretty simple at the time of this writing. The
configuration database is replicated every hours to a slave XiVO. The
slave XiVO pings the master XiVO every 30 seconds and launches asterisk
if the master is down. The slave will also stop asterisk if the master
is turned back up. The check (a ping) is pretty simple at the moment,
this means that a fail-over will not happen if asterisk or any other
service has crashed, monit should be able to restart the crashed service
in most cases anyway.</p>
<p>To enable this feature, go to <em>Configuration, High availability</em>. Choose
master node on the master and enter the slave's IP address in the remote
address field. On the slave, choose slave node and enter the master's IP
address in the remote address field.</p>
<p><img alt="ha_master.png" src="/public/.ha_master_m.jpg" title="ha_master.png, mar. 2012" /></p>
<p>There is no way to trigger a synchronization between master and slave
from the web interface, a work around is to launch
xivo-master-slave-db-replication &lt;slave-ip&gt; on the master XiVO.
This might be useful if you just finished your configuration and want to
trigger a first replication or for test purposes.</p>
<p>Some limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>This solution uses the backup registrar from the phones, see the
    <a href="http://documentation.xivo.fr" title="documentation">documentation</a> for
    supported phones.</li>
<li>Voice mail messages are not replicated between master and slave. A
    solution is to attach the message and to mail it in the notification
    and delete the message from the server when high availability
    is enabled.</li>
<li>CEL are not replicated between master and slave. Calls on the slave
    are logged on the slave and calls on the master are logged on
    the master.</li>
</ul>
