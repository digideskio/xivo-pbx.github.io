    <h2><a href="http://blog.xivo.io/xivos-new-directory-server.html#xivos-new-directory-server">XiVO's new directory server</a></h2>
    <p>
      Posted on Fri 26 September 2014 in <a href="http://blog.xivo.io/category/software.html">Software</a>
    </p>

  <div>
      <p>Some of you may know that a new version of the <a href="/public/xivo-client/Contacts.jpg" title="XiVO client">XiVO
client</a> is being worked
on at the moment. The newlook and feel require some work behind the
scenes to merge all kindof contacts a XiVO user might have into a single
source of information.</p>
<p>What does all this meanÂ ? A personal contact, an entry from an LDAP
server or another XiVO usershould all be available to the user as one
single list of contacts, even if some operations are not available on
all kinds of entries.</p>
<p>We already had a directory xlet that merged XiVO users and remote
directoryentries into a single list. This xlet is used by the
switchboard profile.The directory xlet does most of the heavy lifting of
merging the different contactlists on the client side. This solution is
not ideal for the future of XiVO as we wouldlike to be able to develop a
mobile or web-based version of the client without theburden of rewriting
the same logic.</p>
<p>The first step of our work on this new client is to move this directory
logicback on the server side. To do so, we are creating a new directory
service, namedxivo-dird, that will be responsible of handling all
queries made to all configured directory sources ona XiVO.</p>
<p>This new service will offer a public REST interface. This means that
custom client-side applicationswill be able to integrate the services
provided by xivo-dird easily. We are also making this newservice
runnable without a complete XiVO ecosystem. It will be possible to
installxivo-dird on a dedicated server or in a container. The nature of
the work doneon xivo-dird will also make it easy to run the service in a
distributed manner. Withsome configuration, an administrator will be
able to have many xivo-dird servers running behinda load balancer so
that it may be used by many XiVOs simultaneously. For example:Avencall
has one xivo per office but could use the same xivo-dird proxy for all
offices.</p>
<p><img alt="archi-xivo-dird.svg" src="/public/architecture/archi-xivo-dird.svg" title="archi-xivo-dird.svg, sept. 2014" /></p>
<h3>Architecture</h3>
<p>We are also designing xivo-dird for extensibility and we are trying to
makeplugins as easy as possible to create, making it easier for the
community to contribute.</p>
<h4>Plugins</h4>
<p>Currently planned extension points include:</p>
<h5>Backends</h5>
<p>Backends are plugins that are used to query directory sources. This is
where we find the logicfor retrieving data from a specific kind of
technology. Backends include, but arenot limited to, ldap, csv,
xivo-directory (the internal directory of a
XiVO),xivo-personal-directory (user's personal contact).</p>
<h5>HTTP views</h5>
<p>HTTP views are different URLs that are exposed by the xivo-dird server.
At themoment we know that we will have a json view that will be used by
other XiVOservices to retrieve lookup results. Other views will be added
to support otherneeds. Phones are a good example of consumers that
require a customized view.Adding support for a new brand of phone to
xivo-dird will be a matter of addingthe HTTP view plugin that formats
the lookup results in a way that the phoneunderstands.</p>
<h4>Core</h4>
<p>The core of the application is responsible for loading all of the
plugins.We will probably use a third party library for this job. We have
a proof ofconcept using
<a href="http://stevedore.readthedocs.org/en/latest/" title="stevedore">stevedore</a>at
the moment. Concurrency is also managed by the core.</p>
<p>This kind of architecture will become the reference for other XiVO
services. Having modular servicesthat can be executed independently from
each other will allow us scale therequired parts of XiVO when needed.</p>
<p>You can look at the <a href="https://github.com/xivo-pbx/xivo-dird" title="github repository">github
repository</a>to
view the source code and follow our work. Note that the master branch
does not include thiswork yet. The code in other branches are proof of
concepts used to confirm that our architecturecould handle the kind of
load we were aiming for and that our modular architecture could
beachieved but this code is not meant for production and will be
replaced once we write theproduction version.</p>

    <p>
      Posted on Mon 21 October 2013 in <a href="http://blog.xivo.io/category/xivo-ipbx.html">XiVO IPBX</a>
    </p>

      <p>It's been a while since we gave any updates, but we've been quite
active.</p>
<p>We are currently writing a REST API to configure XiVO, giving access to
asimplified set of the Web interface's controls and replacing thecurrent
Web services. A few examples of what can be done with this API
includelisting users, lines, extensions, devices, voicemails, creating
users, givingthem a SIP line and an extension. The documentation of the
API is available
<a href="http://documentation.xivo.fr/dev/api_sdk/rest_api/1.1/api-1.1.html" title="API documentation">online</a>.</p>
<p>The REST API offers one new feature that is not possible via the Web
interface:associating multiple users to a single SIP line. The main use
case is for multipleusers sharing the same physical phone. They can be
called using the same ordifferent extensions.</p>
<p>The next step to improve the rest api would be to associate a device to
a user,which can currently only be done via the web interface.
unfortunately, thisrequires cleaning and rewriting in python a pretty
big bunch of code fromthe php web interface, mainly because of the
handling of programmablefunction keys, so we are taking the time to do
it right.</p>
<p>This development has three consequences:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First, we are cleaning the storage systems for users, lines, devices,
etc., which means changing the database schema and removing useless data
caches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second, we are developing a Python interface to configure XiVO, which
our REST API uses, and which eventually third-party Python scripts will
be able to use, once it is documented.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Third, we're pushing all configuration events into a software bus
(RabbitMQ), so that XiVO components are aware of configuration changes,
and eventually third-party programs may be aware of them as well. Again,
this will be available once it is documented.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We are also going towards upgrading XiVO to the next version of Debian
namedWheezy. The next step is to backport PostgreSQL from Wheezy, so
that thedatabase migration, which is not so simple, is not done at the
same time as thewhole system upgrade.</p>
<p>Finally, we moved all our Git repositories to Github. Some time ago, we
movedsome of our repositories to Gitorious, which we preferred because
it iscompletely based on free software, but we've had a few problems
with it.So we decided to switch to Github. You can now fork us at
