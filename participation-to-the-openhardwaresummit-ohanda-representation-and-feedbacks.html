    <p>It was a great pleasure to participate to the <strong>OpenHardwareSummit2010
in the New York City Museum of Science</strong> and representing the OHANDA
trademark during the LAW panel. Thanks to Alicia and Ayah to have
organized such an event that gives publicity to the OpenHardware
movement out-there. I have surely pushed the usage of the world
<strong>OpenHardware</strong> (versus the OpenSource-Hardware term that seems to
close to OpenSource software) for the future as the common term for the
hardware projects opening their production and design files. The
audience was 200 people and mainly north-american and that was a great
pleasure to speak and recall the great previous OpenHardware projects
launched in Europe since years now (OpenMoko, OpenPCD, Milkymist,
OpenPattern...).</p>
<p>The summit was a one-day long session of presentations and panel
discussions followed by an exchange about the OpenHardware definition.
During the LAW panel discussion, I had the opportunity to present the
OHANDA trademark and</p>
<p>Some discussions panels attracted my attention :</p>
<p><strong>* PRODUCTIZING: Scaling/ Manufacturing/ Moving beyond DIY :</strong></p>
<p><img alt="OHS2010 - Production
panel" src="/public/.P1040509_m.jpg" title="OHS2010 - Production panel, oct. 2010" />  </p>
<p>This talk was a great opportunity to have the feedbacks of a production
facilities (Clint Cooley from Circuit Co) that supports OpenHardware
projects in the US and see a great ramp-up of the projects requesting
small, medium and large fab of the their PCBs. We can see that some
manufacturers will play a great role in this field and some OpenHardware
project will be able to mutualize some aspects of the production for
bigger PCBs (more layers, 200-500-1000 components-BOM...).</p>
<p><strong>* BUSINESS: Open hardware business models :</strong></p>
<p><img alt="OHS2010 - Marketing
panel" src="/public/.P1040507_m.jpg" title="OHS2010 - Marketing panel, oct. 2010" />  </p>
<p>This talk gives the occasion to hear several business model of
OpenHardware companies ("yes" there is a business model for OpenHardware
projects up to several 100k units per product a year) w/ the
participation of prototyping and products companies such as Chumby
(represented by Bunny skype-ing from Singapore). Definitely the opening
of the design and production files is giving business opportunities for
partners (resellers, hardware-mods, software-hacks, global solutions)
rather than opening the pandora box of copies for cheaper was the global
conclusion of this panel discussion.</p>
<p><strong>* LAW: Open hardware licenses and norms :</strong></p>
<p><img alt="OHS LawPanel
1" src="/public/.OHS_LawPanel_1_m.jpg" title="OHS LawPanel 1, oct. 2010" />  </p>
<p>This panel discussion was the occasion to have around the table several
legal opinions (with lawyers, Peter Brown from the FSF, a hardware
hacker) leading to the following topics :</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>* What is the interest of opening hardware ?
* How to protect a licence/trademark-ed OpenHardware project in case of legal violation from a files point of view ?
* What about the closed documentation of the chips used in an OpenHardware ?
* What about the firmware used in SoC -based OpenHardware projects ?
</pre></div>


<p>Perter Brown from FSF was applausing the 4 freedoms of the OHANDA
trademark adapting the ones from the FSF licence.</p>
<p>Below I have collected some documentations and informations about the
OHS2010 :</p>
