    <p>What must be understood is that if you install provd but you do not
install any plugins, the server won't be able to configure anything.
This means that without plugins, provd is pretty useless.</p>
<p>Each plugin can configure devices from configuration specifications.
Plugins can also offer some additional services, like the downloading of
external files, like firmware or dictionary files for example. So what
was done before by xivo_fetchfw is now partially integrated in each and
every plugin.</p>
<p>One important particularity of this system is that each plugin is
isolated from the others. Besides, and unlike the old provisioning
server, the plugins doesn't share a common directory like /tftpboot.
This way, there's never a conflict between the files used by the
different plugins, and this make it easy to have for example a
xivo-aastra-3.2.0.1011 and a xivo-aastra-2.6.0.2019 plugin on the same
server.</p>
<p>This means that with provd, you can have at the same time and on the
same network, for example, two Aastra 6730i, one using the 2.6.0.2019
firmware and another using the 3.2.0.1011 firmware, and this using the
same DHCP server configuration for the two devices. From the point of
view of both devices, their firmware will be located at
http://&lt;provd_ip&gt;/6730i.st, but for one, this will be a firmware
in version 2.6.0.2019, and for the other, a firmware in version
3.2.0.1011. And if you are curious and point your web browser to this
URL, you'll get an error 404 !</p>
<p>We must know that provd, unlike the old provisioning server, doesn't
depend on an external HTTP/TFTP server to process the requests, since it
handles these requests by itself. This was becoming necessary with the
introduction of the plugin system and the 'dynamic' request processing.</p>
<p>Now, if you are a mentally sane person, you might be asking yourself if
this whole system is based on sound principles. And I have a good news
for you; you are not insane, this system is not based on sound
principles <em>a priori</em>.</p>
<p>In fact, for this system to becomes reliable, a precondition must be
true: for each request, it should be possible to unambiguously identify
which device is behind it. With this unambiguous information available,
we can then lookup in our device database for the complete information
we have on this device, and then find which plugin should handle the
request, and redirect the request to this plugin.</p>
<p>The good thing about this is that most devices provide this unique
information. For example, the Aastras send their MAC address in the
User-Agent header of each HTTP request they make.</p>
<p>That said, some device doesn't give as much information, like the Cisco
7900, which can only do TFTP requests. This means that sometimes, and
only for some requests, the only 'unique' information we can extract
from a request is the IP address. This does not generally cause problem,
except if you are constantly changing the IP addresses on your network.
And if you enable the provd-DHCP server integration, it will make sure
that the MAC-IP association is always up to date, and this means the
system will be reliable once again.</p>
<p>So, part of provd is only about making this system reliable and finely
tunable if there's any need to fine-tune the behaviour of the system.
And to make thing a bit more clear, here's a high level view of what
happens when an HTTP request is made to the provisioning server:</p>
<p><a href="/public/provd/provd-http-request-flow.png" title="Example HTTP request flow"><img alt="Example HTTP request
flow" src="/public/provd/.provd-http-request-flow_m.jpg" title="Example HTTP request flow, avr. 2011" /></a></p>
<ol>
<li>An Aastra 6730i using firmware 2.6.0.2019, with MAC
    XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX and IP Y.Y.Y.Y, does an HTTP GET request for
    /aastra.cfg to the provd server</li>
<li>The HTTP server component in provd receive the request. It then
    sends it to the 'request processing' component. Note that TFTP
    requests are also being processed by the request
    processing component.</li>
<li>The first step in the request processing is to extract information
    from the request. The goal is to extract the maximum of information
    about the device behind the request, like its MAC address, model,
    vendor, firmware version, serial number, IP address, etc. By
    default, each plugin can participate in this step. In this case, at
    the end of this step, we know that the request comes from an Aastra
    6730i in version 2.6.0.2019, that its MAC address is
    XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX and its IP address is Y.Y.Y.Y.</li>
<li>The second step in the request processing is to retrieve the device
    from the device database using the information extracted at 3. In
    this case, we suppose there was already a device with MAC
    XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX in the device database, so we retrieve it.</li>
<li>The third step is to update the retrieved device using the
    extracted information. For example, we can update information we
    didn't know about the device. We can also do generic operation in
    this step if we needs to. Anyway, in our case, this step is actually
    a no-op.</li>
<li>The last step is to route the request to the HTTP handler that will
    answer the request. In our case, from the device retrieved at 4, we
    know that its associated plugin is xivo-aastra-2.6.0.2019, so the
    request is routed to the HTTP handler of the
    xivo-aastra-2.6.0.2019 plugin.</li>
<li>Finaly, the handler chosen at 6 answer the request. In this case,
    the xivo-aastra-2.6.0.2019 plugin will return the content of its
    var/tftpboot/aastra.cfg file.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, you might be wondering how this work when an unknown device make a
request to the provisioning server. By default, at step 4, if no device
can be found in the database, a new one is added.</p>
<p>Then, at step 5, if a device has no plugin associated to it, an
automatic device association process occurs. Also at this step, a device
with no config associated to it can have a default config associated to
it. So, at the end of step 5, we then have a device with a default
config and an associated plugin although the device was not known from
the provisioning server when the request was received.</p>
<p>So this is what conclude our brief introduction to the plugin model of
the new provisioning server. If you are interested into digging into the
details, you might want to start by looking at the
provd/devices/ident.py python source file (this make me thing I should
rename this file) and the various *.py.conf.* configuration file.</p>
<p>Note that to keep this text at the introduction level, some things
stated here have been slightly simplified and are not 100% exact.</p>
