      <p>Dear XIOH followers and developers,</p>
<p><strong>We are now entering our beta-test period with our first batch of XIOH
appliances</strong> available for shipping for developers and power-users that
could be interested in testing and giving feedback on our product. The
appliances are currently shipped in a metallic 1U-rackable case for up
to 50 users and 10 simultaneous calls. It ships with <a href="http://mirror.xivo.fr/iso/" title="XiVO 12.24">XiVO
12.24</a>. We're using free
<a href="http://git.xivo.fr/?p=official/xioh/firmware.git;a=summary">MSP430
firmware</a>
running the power sequence of voltage levels for the different
functional blocks, and a <a href="http://git.xivo.fr/?p=official/xioh/coreboot.git;a=summary">free CPU boot
firmware</a>
based on <a href="http://coreboot.org">Coreboot</a>. Each ROM contains MAC
addresses with our OUI prefix, and a serial number. <a href="http://git.xivo.fr/?p=official/xioh/hardware.git;a=summary">Public design
source
files</a> are
also available.</p>
<p><strong>Here is a glimpse on the look-and-feel of the appliance:</strong></p>

<p>If anyone is interested, please contact us at
xcarcelle_at_avencall_dot_com for availability and potential
shipping.</p>
<p>The feedback of our first appliances running in production in 5
different locations are good and we are able to confirm that we can
handle up to 1000 calls a day on a single XiVO IOH.</p>

    <h2><a href="http://blog.xivo.io/a-switchboard-for-xivo.html#a-switchboard-for-xivo">A Switchboard for XiVO</a></h2>
    <p>
      Posted on Fri 14 December 2012 in <a href="http://blog.xivo.io/category/software.html">Software</a>
    </p>

  <div>
      <p>One of the long time missing feature of XiVO is a good switchboard
interface. We havebeen working on a new switchboard profile for the XiVO
client and this post isan overview of what you might expect in the next
few releases.</p>
<p><img alt="switchboard.png" src="/public/.switchboard_m.jpg" title="switchboard.png, déc. 2012" /></p>
<p>As we've said before, we are now releasing a new version every two weeks
andeach release must succeed our test suite before being sent into
production.That means that we will have to ship the new switchboard one
piece at a time. Thefirst three user stories of the switchboard will be
available in the nextrelease (12.24). In fact, one of these story was
already implemented in 12.23but we did not send this release into
production since we are replacingchan_agent with xivo-agent, but that's
another story.</p>
<p>The first user story is to be able to answer an incoming call with a
click ora key press. To accomplish this goal, we created a new xlet
called switchboard,not to be confused with the switchboard profile. The
switchboard xlet issplitted in three sections, incoming calls on the
left, calls on hold on the right andthe current call on the top spanning
from left to right. When a call reachesthe switchboard, it is shown in
the list on the left of the switchboard. Theoperator can then press
enter or click the call to answer it.</p>
<p>The call flow leads us to the next user story, which is to show the
currentcall at the top of the switchboard xlet. The caller id name and
number areavailable and buttons are available for each actions that can
be done on thatcall. Each button also has a key binding to allow fast
call distribution.Actions will be added to this frame until each desired
action is present.At the end of the current sprint, only hangup and hold
will be available.</p>
<p>The third story that we are addressing is the holded call list that is
on theright side of the xlet. These are the calls that have been
answered by theoperator a first time but that have not been distributed
yet (excluding thecurrent call).</p>
<p>All of these new functinnality are planned for version 12.24 that will
bereleased on december 19th.</p>
<p>What are the next steps</p>
<ul>
<li>Call transfers (the contact xlet can already be used to transfer to
    other users)</li>
<li>Call tracking (to know what happenned to previously
    distributed calls)</li>
</ul>
<p>See the documentation for all the details to enable your new XiVO
switchboard.</p>

      <p>Hello once again XiVO followers ! What's this ? My first blog post has
barely been published and i've already written a second one ! But this
time, i'll be writing about something that will be more interesting for
1337 h@X0r\$ and the like: the Hackfest !</p>
<h3>Hackfest ? What's a Hackfest ?</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.hackfest.ca" title="Hackfest">Hackfest</a> is one of the biggest
events about computer security in the province of Quebec. This year,
more than 400 participants were treated to 2 days full of conferences
and hacking games like Lockpicking, Cyber warfare and Capture The Flag.</p>
<p><img alt="Hackfest
cyberwar" src="/public/HackFest2012/.hackfest_cyberwar_m.jpg" title="Hackfest cyberwar, Nov 2012" /></p>
<p>XiVO also participated in the Hackfest by giving a conference and
organising the XiVO pwn2own hacking game.</p>
<h3>What kind of conference ?</h3>
<p>We gave a conference about the security and future of free
telecommunications, the slides are available in attachment of this post.
The conference was supposed to be given by our colleague <a href="http://twitter.com/nicboul" title="Nicolas Bouliane's twitter feed">Nicolas
Bouliane</a>,
but unfortunately, he got sick a few days before the event. Me and my
SCRUM master gave the talk instead. Here's a picture of us during the
conference. As you can see, the room was pretty full !</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hackfest2k9/8147555929/" title="Hackfest 2012: avencall #hf2012 by hackfest.ca, on Flickr"><img alt="Hackfest 2012: avencall
#hf2012" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8328/8147555929_6aa0caf977.jpg" /></a></p>
<h3>What about the pwn2own ?</h3>
<p>Hackers were given 48 hours to try and hack a standard XiVO server and
find the most exploits possible. As the game went on, clues were given
out through our twitter feed.</p>
<p><img alt="XiVO twitter
feed" src="/public/HackFest2012/.xivo_twitter_feed_m.jpg" title="XiVO twitter feed, Nov 2012" /></p>
<p>Once a hacker found an exploit, he could submit it to our scoreboard to
win points. At the end of the game, the top 3 teams with the most points
won cash prizes. Here's a screenshot of the scoreboard at the end of the
game.</p>
<p><img alt="XiVO
Scoreboard" src="/public/HackFest2012/.xivo_score_board_m.jpg" title="XiVO Scoreboard, Nov 2012" /></p>
<h3>So what happened ? Did you get hacked ?!</h3>
<p>Yes ! As you can see from the scoreboard, 3 teams were able to find
quite a few exploits in XiVO. What surprised us most was the number of
hacks that were found on the web interface. Since XiVO is first and
foremost a telephony system, we thought that the hackers would
concentrate on hacking the telephone services (For example, control SIP
accounts, create fake telephones through the Provisionning service, DDoS
the Asterisk server) After all, the web interface is only used for
administrative purposes and isn't a critical piece of the XiVO server.
Instead, we got a total of 10 web exploits and only 1 telephone exploit.</p>
<h3>What happens now ?</h3>
<p>The XiVO dev team is working on fixing all the exploits found during the
pwn2own. The fixes will be released in version 12.22 at the end of next
week.</p>
<p>All in all, we had great fun participating in the Hackfest. We're
already thinking about how we can make the game more exciting next year,
like how to encourage people to go explore more of XiVO's telephony
services.</p>
<p>Thanks again to the 3 teams who participated in XIVO's pwn2own
(RingZer0, Abed&amp;Francis and Bitducks). We look forward to more hacking
next year !</p>

<p>For a second year, Avencall was present on the biggest Asterisk
conference in the world: Astricon.This year, the conference was held in
Georgia, Atlanta.</p>
<p>Like every year, the Monday is the AstriDevCon, a small conference for
developers by the developers to discuss the future and how to improve
Asterisk. It's a very nice place to get to know the other people that
are coding inside Asterisk and also to coordinate with others about what
has to be done.</p>
<p>You can find a nice resume of the whole day of discussion here:
<a href="https://wiki.asterisk.org/wiki/display/AST/AstriDevCon+2012">https://wiki.asterisk.org/wiki/display/AST/AstriDevCon+2012</a></p>
<p>As you can see, this year we also had a booth (#28). It was a great
experience to expose ourself at Astricon because there is a huge flow of
people interested and interesting. It was a lot of fun to talk about the
XiVO project and the XiVO Open Hardware. All the gizmos we had on our
table really attracted may people, especially the raspberry pi that was
running XiVO.</p>

<p>To communicate further about us, we also gave a conference to present
Avencall and the XiVO telephony system.</p>
