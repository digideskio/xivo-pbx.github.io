  </header>
  <div>
      <p>Greetings fellow XiVO fans, I am pleased to announce the release of XiVO 16.01.</p>
<h2>New features in this sprint</h2>
<p><strong>XiVO Client Authentication</strong>: The XiVO client can use LDAP authentication for connecting to the XiVO server. This
makes it easier for administrators to reuse services that manage their user accounts, such as Active Directory. LDAP
authentication is managed by a new authentication backend configurable via the CTI. This backend requires manual
configuration on the server. Further details can be obtained in the upgrade notes.</p>
<p><strong>XiVO Client Connections</strong>: The XiVO client will issue a warning when it is unable to connect to the server using an
encrypted connection. Users will have the option of reconnecting to the server using an unencrypted connection.
Encrypted connections can be reactivated by clicking on the lock in the client's configuration window.</p>
<p><strong>SIP:</strong> A new tab has been added to the page for configuring advanced options in SIP accounts. Advanced options can be
added via the "advanced" tab on the lines page. These parameters will be included along side the rest of the SIP
configuration in Asterisk. The advanced tab offers more flexibility to advanced users of Asterisk, while still keeping
the rest of the UI simple enough for regular users.</p>
<p><strong>Web Interface:</strong> A few minor improvements have been added to the web interface's UI:</p>
<ul>
<li>A search bar has been added to the context page</li>
<li>The user's extension will now be displayed next to his name in multiselect boxes</li>
<li>The line associated to a device can be edited by clicking on its number in the device list</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>REST API:</strong> A new API for managing "custom" endpoints has been added. Custom endpoints enable the use of communication
protocols that are supported by Asterisk but not fully managed by XiVO, such as DAHDI cards. This new API represents an
additional step towards our long-term goal of offering a PBX system that is more flexible, customizable and useful for
third party developers.</p>
<h2>Technical Features</h2>
<p><strong>Snom phones:</strong> The plugin for Snom phones has been upgraded to version 8.7.5.35 of the firmware.</p>
<p><strong>DAHDI upgrade:</strong> DAHDI has been upgraded to version 2.11</p>
<p><strong>Consul upgrade:</strong> Consul has been upgraded to version 0.6.3</p>
<p><strong>Asterisk upgrade:</strong> Asterisk has been upgraded to version 13.7.0</p>
<p><strong>Web account ACLs</strong>: The permission system used for web service accounts has been replaced by Access Control Lists
(ACL). ACLs are a part of our ongoing work on our new permission system. This system improves security in XiVO for
various subsystems, such as communication between services. In the long term, ACLs will also permit users to access
parts of in a restricted mode, giving them the possibility of customizing different features without impacting other
parts of the system.</p>
<p><strong>CTI protocol version</strong>: The CTI protocol has been upgraded to 2.0. XiVO Clients will issue a warning when connecting
to a server that uses a version of the protocol that is incompatible with the current version of the client.</p>
<h2>Ongoing features</h2>
<p><strong>REST API:</strong> We will be working on a new API for associating devices with SIP or SCCP accounts.</p>
<p><strong>Switchboard:</strong> We are changing the internals of the Switchboard feature so that we can control more precisely how
calls are answered, transferred, etc.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>My fellow xivoists, as the <strong>Lord of XiVO</strong> allow me to bid you a happy and invigorating farewell. I wish you shall
remain in high spirits until our next fateful encounter, 3 weeks from now. May the freedom of XiVO bless your
communications across the vast VoIP expanse.</em></p>

    <h2><a href="http://blog.xivo.io/sprint-review-1520.html#sprint-review-1520">Sprint Review 15.20</a></h2>
    <p>
      Posted on Fri 08 January 2016 in <a href="http://blog.xivo.io/category/xivo-ipbx.html">XiVO IPBX</a>
      &#8226; Tagged with

  </header>
  <div>
      <p>Greetings fellow XiVO fans, allow me to wish you all a happy new year ! I am pleased to announce that the first version
of XiVO in 2016, version 15.20, has been released. Since we have started a new year, the next version of XiVO will be
numbered 16.01.</p>
<h2>New features in this sprint</h2>
<p><strong>REST API</strong>: New APIs for managing users via CSV files have been added. CSV files can now be used for updating users
and their associated resources such as lines, extensions, CTI profiles, incalls and voicemails. Users can also be
exported to a CSV file. The goal of this API is to make the management of a XiVO more efficient when administrators need
to modify a great number of users at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>XiVO Client</strong>: Contact searches using context separation can now be activated through the web interface. Context
separation allows groups of users to be isolated from one another by grouping them into "contexts". This feature becomes
useful when you want to separate users from different organizations, but still keep them all on the same server. For
example: schools, business offices, etc. In version 15.19, this feature needed manual configuration on the server. This
configuration is no longer necessary.</p>
<p><strong>XiVO Client</strong>: Users can now chat with people on other servers. Before, people using a XiVO Client could only chat
with users that were on the same server. With version 15.20, people will be able to chat with users on other servers
when these servers have been <a href="http://documentation.xivo.fr/en/stable/scalability_and_distributed_systems/contact_and_presence_sharing.html">configured to communicate together</a>.</p>
<h2>Technical Features</h2>
<p><strong>OS Upgrade</strong>: 15.20 will be the first version of XiVO running under the latest version of Debian GNU/Linux, also known
as "Jessie". Many libraries and programs that run on a XiVO server have also been upgraded. This upgrade helps to
improve the overall stability and security of XiVO and allows to use the latest technologies available in order to
develop new and exciting features.</p>
<p><strong>XiVO Client connections</strong>: Both standard and encrypted connections now use port 5003. In previous versions, encrypted
connections had to be reconfigured client-side in order to use a different port. Changing the port is no longer
necessary. Encrypted connections can now be activated by simply clicking on the lock in the client's configuration
window.</p>
<h2>Ongoing features</h2>
<p><strong>Lines:</strong> We are revamping the web interface in a similar fashion to what was done for voicemails. The goal is to make
configuration of advanced parameters easier while still keeping the interface simple.</p>
<p><strong>Switchboard:</strong> We are changing the internals of the Switchboard feature so that we can control more precisely how
calls are answered, transferred, etc.</p>
<p><strong>LDAP authentication</strong>: We are working on new authentication mechanisms. We are adding LDAP authentication to the XiVO
Client. This allows administrators to reuse their existing infrastructure in order to manage and authenticate users
from different systems, such as an Active Directory server.</p>

    <h2><a href="http://blog.xivo.io/sprint-review-1519.html#sprint-review-1519">Sprint Review 15.19</a></h2>
    <p>
      Posted on Fri 04 December 2015 in <a href="http://blog.xivo.io/category/xivo-ipbx.html">XiVO IPBX</a>
      &#8226; Tagged with
      <a href="http://blog.xivo.io/tag/xivo.html">XiVO</a>,      <a href="http://blog.xivo.io/tag/development.html">development</a>    </p>
  </header>
  <div>
      <p>Greetings fellow XiVO fans ! I am pleased to announce that version 15.19 of XiVO has been released.
This will be our last version released in 2015. The next version, 15.20, will be released during
the month of January in 2016.</p>
<h2>New features in this sprint</h2>
<p><strong>Call Forwards</strong>: Unconditional forwards on a phone can be updated through a single operation. When you wish
to update the phone number on a forward, simply dial <code>*21&lt;new_number&gt;</code> and the forward will be
automatically updated.</p>
<p><strong>REST API:</strong> A new API for importing users en masse has been added. A CSV file can be used for
importing users, lines, extensions, cti profiles, incalls, and voicemails in a single operation. The
goal of this API is to accelerate the installation and configuration of a server when deploying one
or more XiVOs.</p>
<p><strong>REST API:</strong> The search system on confd APIs has been improved. You can now filter results using
exact matches on any field for a given resource. For example : If you have two users named "John
Smith" and "Jane Smith", you can search for users who only have "Jane" as a firstname. These
improvements allow API users to search and filter results more precisely.</p>
<p><strong>REST API:</strong> A new API for remotely initiating calls has been added. This feature can be used
for implementing custom services related to calling services, such as automatically dialing
a client's phone number, or call reminders at a specific time.</p>
<p><strong>XiVO Client</strong>: The new People xlet now has buttons for transfering calls to voicemails, sending
emails, and chatting with other users. This means that it is now feature complete and can be used as
a replacement for the old Contacts xlet. The XiVO dev team is very proud to have completed this major
milestone ! The old Contacts xlet has now been removed from the client.</p>
<p><strong>Caller ID:</strong> The caller ID lookup service has been improved. Lookups now include searches in your
personal contacts. This means that when one of your personal contacts calls you, instead of seeing
only her number, you will see her name along with her number.</p>
<h2>Security Advisory</h2>
<p>2 security bugs have been fixed in this sprint. Security advisories for vunerable versions of xivo
have been released and can be consulted on the <a href="http://mirror.xivo.io/security">security advisory page</a></p>
<h2>Ongoing features</h2>
<p><strong>OS Upgrade:</strong> We will be upgrading the version of Debian GNU/Linux, on which XiVO is based, from
Wheezy to Jessie. This will upgrade many libraires and programs running on
a server to newer versions.</p>
<p><strong>User import:</strong> We will be adding more features to the user import API in order
to update information that has already been imported.</p>
<p><strong>Lines:</strong> We are revamping the web interface in a similar fashion to what was done for
voicemails. The goal is to make configuration of advanced parameters easier while
still keeping the interface simple.</p>
<p><strong>Switchboard:</strong> We are changing the internals of the Switchboard feature so that
we can control more precisely how calls are answered, transferred, etc.</p>
<h2>Technical features</h2>
<ul>
<li>We have started working on a permission system in order to better secure communications between
 services on a XiVO server. In the long term, this work will also enable users to access
 various xivo subsystems in a restricted mode, allowing them the possibility of customizing
 different features without impacting other parts of the system.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><em>My fellow xivoists, as the <strong>Lord of XiVO</strong> allow me to wish you all a merry christmas and a
happy new year ! May your spirits remain joyous until the end of the year and throughout 2016.
May the freedom of XiVO bless your communications across the vast VoIP expanse.</em></p>

    <h2><a href="http://blog.xivo.io/sprint-review-1518.html#sprint-review-1518">Sprint Review 15.18</a></h2>
    <p>
      Posted on Fri 13 November 2015 in <a href="http://blog.xivo.io/category/xivo-ipbx.html">XiVO IPBX</a>
      &#8226; Tagged with
      <a href="http://blog.xivo.io/tag/xivo.html">XiVO</a>,      <a href="http://blog.xivo.io/tag/development.html">development</a>    </p>
  </header>
  <div>
      <p>Hi everyone, this release was delayed by a week because we moved our development
office in another spot in Quebec City. It's smaller, but more adapted to our
team size (there are 6 of us now, and the previous office was designed for more
than 10 people). And we managed to keep <a href="http://blog.xivo.io/we-are-6-and-yes-we-have-more-than-150-phones.html">all our
phones</a>.
Also, we've been told it was hard to know when the next release was due, so
we've added the planned release dates in the
<a href="http://projects.xivo.io/projects/xivo/roadmap">Roadmap</a>. Here are the news for
the version 15.18 of XiVO.</p>
<h2>New features in this sprint</h2>
<p><strong>REST API:</strong> A new API for managing SCCP accounts has been added. The API can
be used for creating SCCP accounts and associating them with users on a XiVO
server. This API also offers third parties, such as developers or
administrators, the flexibility of configuring all of the advanced SCCP
parameters offered by asterisk. This new API helps us expand on our goal of
offering a more customizable and flexible system ideal for use in a wide range
of environments, such as cloud infrastructures.</p>
<p><strong>Fax:</strong> The fax feature in the XiVO Client may now be used with encryption and
NAT. We are fixing these issues so that we can make the XiVO Client encryption
usable by default, to allow the new authentication system to be used (which will
allow LDAP authentication).</p>
<h2>Ongoing features</h2>
<p><strong>HTTPS:</strong> We continue to extend the use of encryption for communication between
XiVO components. From this version, consul and xivo-agent may only communicate
over HTTPS. The goal is to allow XiVO components to be installed on different
machines without sending important information in clear text, so that the load
may be easily balanced in order to increase the maximum number of calls that
XiVO can sustain.</p>
<p><strong>Lines:</strong> We are revamping the web interface in a similar fashion to what was done for
voicemails. The goal is to make configuration of advanced parameters easier while
still keeping the interface simple.</p>
<p><strong>CTI:</strong> We are also working on making XiVO Client statuses to be visible across
multiple XiVO servers. This means that we can see whether a user is on the phone
or available, even if he is registered on another XiVO server.</p>
<p><strong>Caller ID:</strong> Finally, we are changing the system of incoming caller ID lookup,
so that it includes your personal contacts. This means that, when one of your
personal contacts calls you, instead of seeing only her number, you will see her
name (that you entered) along with her number.</p>
<h2>Technical features</h2>
<p><strong>Polycom phones:</strong> the new firmwares VVX 5.3.1 and SoundStation 4.0.9 are available.</p>
<p><strong>Snom phones:</strong> the new firmware 8.7.5.28 is available.</p>
<hr />
<p>See you at the next sprint review.</p>

      <p>Hello, my name is Nicolas (h4wk3r on irc #xivo). I am a currently alternating between my studies for
a Master in Computer Engineering and my work in a call center. I could not find any information in
the XiVO CTI when a phone was disconnected, so I worked on a solution for generating this
information. This allows agents to know their phone's status.</p>
<p>Let us imagine the following scenario: An agent in a call center is connected with is softphone 'N.
SIP XXX'. He logs in via his XiVO Client in order to receive calls from his assigned queues. One of
the following 3 events occurs :</p>
<p>A – The softphone is disconnected from asterisk .
B – The agent finishes his day, turns off his softphone but forgets to disconnect his XiVO Client
C – The agent is at home, the VPN tunnel stops</p>
<p>In these 3 examples, the agent cannot know if he can still recieve calls because he does not recieve
any alerts from his XiVO client or from the phone.</p>
<h1>I. Standard operation</h1>
<h2>Agent's point of view</h2>
<p><img alt="photo 1" src="http://blog.xivo.io/public/agent_disconnect/photo1.png" /></p>
<h2>Point of view on the XiVO Server</h2>
<p><img alt="photo 2" src="http://blog.xivo.io/public/agent_disconnect/photo2.png" /></p>
<h1>II. Anomaly</h1>
<h2>Agent's point of view</h2>
<p>Let us simulate the anomaly. For this simulation, the softphone has been forcefully disconnected.</p>
<p><img alt="photo 3" src="http://blog.xivo.io/public/agent_disconnect/photo3.png" /></p>
<p><strong>We can see that our agent is still logged in and no other information about the disconnection is
displayed</strong></p>
<h2>Point of view on the XiVO Server</h2>
<p><img alt="photo 4" src="http://blog.xivo.io/public/agent_disconnect/photo4.png" /></p>
<p>We can see that the state of extension 741 is <code>UNKNOWN</code>, but agent 6002 (extension 728) is still
connected.</p>
<h1>III. Execution of the script</h1>
<p>The script will find out that the SIP account is disconnected and will automatically log out the
agent associated to the extension.</p>
<p><img alt="photo 5" src="http://blog.xivo.io/public/agent_disconnect/photo5.png" /></p>
<p>Accordingly, the agent now knows that he is logged out:</p>
<p><img alt="photo 6" src="http://blog.xivo.io/public/agent_disconnect/photo6.png" /></p>
<p>This script has been deployed in production and has been working successfully since Oct 1st 2015.
You can download this script on <a href="https://github.com/h4wk3r/XIVO-Agentoff_if_sipoff">github</a>.</p>
<p>For further information, you can contact me directly be email (vdbnicolas [at] gmail [dot] com) or
on IRC on irc.freenode.net channel #xivo.</p>
