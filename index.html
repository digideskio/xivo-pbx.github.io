      <p>Greetings fellow XiVO fans, it is my pleasure to announce the release of XiVO 16.05.</p>
<h2>New features in this sprint</h2>
<p><strong>Translations</strong>: Thanks to the XiVO community (thank you Marcos Tadeu), the XiVO Client and phone directory labels are translated in Portuguese (Brazil).</p>
<p><strong>REST API</strong>: A new API has been added to create and associate call permissions to users. Call permissions enable administrators to control which phone numbers are allowed to be called by users.</p>
<p><strong>SIP Lines</strong>: The SIP lines configuration page has been simplified. A lot of advanced options may now be set freely, independently of what options are supported by the web interface.</p>
<h2>Ongoing features</h2>
<p><strong>Call Transfers</strong>: We are working on a new API for managing call transfers. This will offer third parties more flexibility when developing applications that control the call flows, such as a Web Switchboard. In addition, this new API should solve a number of bugs related to call transfers.</p>
<p><strong>Installation Wizard</strong>: The wizard is the little assistant that allows administrators to setup the XiVO server. The wizard is a very important part of XiVO, since it's the mandatory way to finalize the installation of XiVO. We are working on a new API allowing to setup XiVO automatically, without the need of the XiVO web interface. Also there are some known bugs in the current wizard blocking the end of the installation that would put beginners to a complete stop before even trying XiVO. So the time has come to squash those nasty bugs!</p>

<p>See you at the next sprint review!</p>

      <p>Hello XiVO community! Here comes the release of XiVO 16.06!</p>
<h2>New features in this sprint</h2>
<p><strong>Installation Wizard</strong>: The wizard is the little assistant that allows administrators to setup the XiVO server. The wizard is a very important part of XiVO, since it's the mandatory way to finalize the installation of XiVO. We have released a new API allowing to setup XiVO automatically, without the need of the XiVO web interface. Also a number of bugs related to the wizard were fixed.</p>
<p><strong>XiVO Client</strong>: Thanks to the XiVO community (thank you Julien Revert), the deployment of the XiVO Client for Windows on multiple machines is easier in 16.06. This facilitates upgrading the version of XiVO and the XiVO Client together.</p>
<h2>Technical Features</h2>
<p><strong>Polycom phones:</strong> The plugin for Polycom phones has been upgraded to version 5.4.3 of the firmware. Also, two new models are supported: VVX101 and VVX201.</p>
<p><strong>Personal contacts</strong>: The import of personal contacts has been improved: there were some performance issues that are fixed in 16.06, and there can not be any more duplicated personal contacts.</p>
<h2>Ongoing features</h2>
<p><strong>Call Transfers</strong>: We are working on a new API for managing call transfers. This will offer third parties more flexibility when developing applications that control the call flows, such as a Web Switchboard. In addition, this new API should solve a number of bugs related to call transfers.</p>
<p><strong>Entity management</strong>: Entities are used to manage multiple groups of users on the same XiVO server, but each group can't see the other. This is useful for example when managing multiple departments of the same big company, but each department has its own telephony administrator, and each administrator should only see the users of their own department. This feature was until now exclusive to the web interface, but we are working on making this feature manageable through a REST API. Be aware that this is a long-term job, because entities apply to every single configuration object in XiVO. As with other REST APIs, this will allow creating different graphical interfaces for managing XiVO, as well as automating this management.</p>

      <p>Greetings fellow XiVO fans, it is my pleasure to announce the release of XiVO 16.04.</p>
<h2>New features in this sprint</h2>
<p><strong>Fax</strong>: The Fax system in XiVO has been improved, thanks to the XiVO community (thank you Julien Revert). Fax files can be
converted to PDF on reception. Files can also be deposited on a FTP server. Further details on how to configure these
features can be found
<a href="http://documentation.xivo.io/en/latest/administration/fax/fax.html#using-the-ftp-backend">in the documentation</a></p>
<p><strong>Forwards</strong>: The behaviour of the call forwards BLFs is completely consistent across the unconditional, busy and no-answer
forwards. A BLF (Busy Lamp Field) is a small light found next to the function key on a phone. The light helps indicate
to the user if any call forwards are currently active.</p>
<p><strong>XiVO Client</strong>: The Xlet People has received small mouse improvements: it is now possible to copy contact informations
  to the clipboard, such as the phone number or email via a right click.</p>
<p><strong>REST API</strong>: New APIs for managing forwards and services have been integrated to the user resource. All call forwards
can now be fully controlled through the REST API. This new API represents an additional step towards our long-term goal
of offering a PBX system that is more flexible, customizable and useful for third party developers.</p>
<h2>Technical Features</h2>
<p><strong>SCCP</strong>: SCCP phones can be configured to use the G.722 codec.</p>
<p><strong>Digium</strong>: The firmware for Digium cards has been updated to the latest version which supports TE133 and TE435
cards.</p>
<p><strong>Yealink</strong>: The firmware for V80 has been updated to the latest version. Official support for the Yealink T40P and
  community support for the T27P, T29G and T49G has also been added.</p>
<h2>Ongoing features</h2>
<p><strong>REST API</strong>: We are working on new APIs for managing call transfers and call permissions. Call permissions enable
administrators to control which phone numbers are allowed to be called by users. This will offer third parties more
flexibility when developing applications that control the call flows.</p>
<p><strong>Web applications</strong>: Work on tools for connecting web applications to XiVO is ongoing. A good example of a Web
  application is a switchboard application, where the operator may answer, hold and transfer calls from his browser,
  effectively controlling his physical phone. This may also be coupled with a WebRTC softphone, in order to have a full
  Web switchboard environment.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>My fellow xivoists, as the <strong>Lord of XiVO</strong> allow me to bid you a happy and invigorating farewell. I wish you shall
remain in high spirits until our next fateful encounter, 3 weeks from now. May the freedom of XiVO bless your
communications across the vast VoIP expanse.</em></p>

      <p>Greetings fellow XiVO fans, it is my pleasure to announce the release of XiVO 16.03.</p>
<h2>New features in this sprint</h2>
<p><strong>REST API:</strong> A new API for associating a device with a line has been added. Devices can now be fully provisioned and
controlled via the REST API. This new API represents an additional step towards our long-term goal of offering a PBX
system that is more flexible, customizable and useful for third party developers.</p>
<p><strong>Switchboard Statistics</strong>: Calls that go through a switchboard will now generate statistics. Statistics provide
valuable information to managers of an organization when analyzing the amount of calls they receive. These statistics
can be consulted by downloading a CSV file.</p>
<h2>Technical Features</h2>
<p><strong>Websocketd</strong>: Connections made to websocketd can now use backends such as "xivo_user" or "ldap_user" to authenticate
themselves. These connections will only receive events that they are authorized to see.</p>
<p><strong>Service discovery</strong>: xivo-dird and xivo-agentd now register their services via consul.</p>
<p><strong>LDAP authentication</strong>: After discussions with members of the community, the LDAP plugin has been rewritten in order to
adapt more easily to the needs of our users. We have also added these new features:</p>
<ul>
<li>The plugin can optionally be configured to find a user via an LDAP search</li>
<li>The attributes used for matching a user's username and email are configurable</li>
</ul>
<h2>Security Advisory</h2>
<p>A security bug has been fixed in this sprint. Security advisories for vulnerable versions of XiVO
can be consulted on the <a href="http://mirror.xivo.io/security">security advisory page</a></p>
<h2>Ongoing features</h2>
<p><strong>REST API</strong>: We are working on new APIs for managing a users's call services and call forwards. This will offer third
parties more flexibility when developing applications that manage a user's services.</p>
<p><strong>Web applications</strong>: Work on tools for connecting web applications to XiVO is ongoing. A good example of a Web application is a switchboard application, where the operator may answer, hold and transfer calls from his browser, effectively controlling his physical phone. This may also be coupled with a WebRTC softphone, in order to have a full Web switchboard environment.</p>

  <div>
      <p>Hello,</p>
<h2>New features in this sprint</h2>
<p><strong>Users import</strong>: The CSV import of users now supports setting the call permissions for each user. Call permissions define which restriction are put on users regarding which numbers they can dial.</p>
<p><strong>XiVO Client</strong>: All communications between the CTI server and the XiVO Clients will now be encrypted by default.</p>
<p><strong>LDAP authentication</strong>: The LDAP authentication mechanisms now uses the new user field for email address, and is not considered experimental anymore. However, it only supports simple LDAP hierarchies, and we are going to improve it to be more flexible.</p>
<h2>Technical Features</h2>
<p><strong>Asterisk upgrade</strong>: Asterisk has been upgraded from version 13.7.0 to 13.7.2</p>
<h2>Ongoing features</h2>
<p><strong>Security</strong>: We are extending the permission system to all REST APIs. This will allow a finer grained access to the REST APIs and reduce the chances of accidentally breaking the rest of the system. For example, users will be able to modify their function keys, without having access to the function keys of other users.</p>
<p><strong>REST API</strong>: We are working on a new REST API for associating devices with SIP or SCCP accounts.</p>
<p><strong>Web applications</strong>: We are working towards making Web applications connected to XiVO possible. The two things it needs is REST APIs, which are growing more useful, and events, which will be provided via Websockets, introduced in this sprint. A good example of a Web application is a switchboard application, where the operator may answer, hold and transfer calls from his browser, effectively controlling his physical phone. This may also be coupled with a WebRTC softphone, in order to have a full Web switchboard environment.</p>
<p><strong>Switchboard</strong>: We are changing the internals of the Switchboard feature so that we can control more precisely how calls are answered, transferred, etc.</p>
