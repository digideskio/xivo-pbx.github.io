      <p>Greetings fellow XiVO fans, it is my pleasure to announce the release of XiVO 16.05.</p>
<h2>New features in this sprint</h2>
<p><strong>Translations</strong>: Thanks to the XiVO community (thank you Marcos Tadeu), the XiVO Client and phone directory labels are translated in Portuguese (Brazil).</p>
<p><strong>REST API</strong>: A new API has been added to create and associate call permissions to users. Call permissions enable administrators to control which phone numbers are allowed to be called by users.</p>
<p><strong>SIP Lines</strong>: The SIP lines configuration page has been simplified. A lot of advanced options may now be set freely, independently of what options are supported by the web interface.</p>
<h2>Ongoing features</h2>
<p><strong>Call Transfers</strong>: We are working on a new API for managing call transfers. This will offer third parties more flexibility when developing applications that control the call flows, such as a Web Switchboard. In addition, this new API should solve a number of bugs related to call transfers.</p>
<p><strong>Installation Wizard</strong>: The wizard is the little assistant that allows administrators to setup the XiVO server. The wizard is a very important part of XiVO, since it's the mandatory way to finalize the installation of XiVO. We are working on a new API allowing to setup XiVO automatically, without the need of the XiVO web interface. Also there are some known bugs in the current wizard blocking the end of the installation that would put beginners to a complete stop before even trying XiVO. So the time has come to squash those nasty bugs!</p>

<p>See you at the next sprint review!</p>

      <p>Greetings fellow XiVO fans, it is my pleasure to announce the release of XiVO 16.04.</p>
<h2>New features in this sprint</h2>
<p><strong>Fax</strong>: The Fax system in XiVO has been improved, thanks to the XiVO community (thank you Julien Revert). Fax files can be
converted to PDF on reception. Files can also be deposited on a FTP server. Further details on how to configure these
features can be found
<a href="http://documentation.xivo.io/en/latest/administration/fax/fax.html#using-the-ftp-backend">in the documentation</a></p>
<p><strong>Forwards</strong>: The behaviour of the call forwards BLFs is completely consistent across the unconditional, busy and no-answer
forwards. A BLF (Busy Lamp Field) is a small light found next to the function key on a phone. The light helps indicate
to the user if any call forwards are currently active.</p>
<p><strong>XiVO Client</strong>: The Xlet People has received small mouse improvements: it is now possible to copy contact informations
  to the clipboard, such as the phone number or email via a right click.</p>
<p><strong>REST API</strong>: New APIs for managing forwards and services have been integrated to the user resource. All call forwards
can now be fully controlled through the REST API. This new API represents an additional step towards our long-term goal
of offering a PBX system that is more flexible, customizable and useful for third party developers.</p>
<h2>Technical Features</h2>
<p><strong>SCCP</strong>: SCCP phones can be configured to use the G.722 codec.</p>
<p><strong>Digium</strong>: The firmware for Digium cards has been updated to the latest version which supports TE133 and TE435
cards.</p>
<p><strong>Yealink</strong>: The firmware for V80 has been updated to the latest version. Official support for the Yealink T40P and
  community support for the T27P, T29G and T49G has also been added.</p>
<h2>Ongoing features</h2>
<p><strong>REST API</strong>: We are working on new APIs for managing call transfers and call permissions. Call permissions enable
administrators to control which phone numbers are allowed to be called by users. This will offer third parties more
flexibility when developing applications that control the call flows.</p>
<p><strong>Web applications</strong>: Work on tools for connecting web applications to XiVO is ongoing. A good example of a Web
  application is a switchboard application, where the operator may answer, hold and transfer calls from his browser,
  effectively controlling his physical phone. This may also be coupled with a WebRTC softphone, in order to have a full
  Web switchboard environment.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>My fellow xivoists, as the <strong>Lord of XiVO</strong> allow me to bid you a happy and invigorating farewell. I wish you shall
remain in high spirits until our next fateful encounter, 3 weeks from now. May the freedom of XiVO bless your
communications across the vast VoIP expanse.</em></p>

      <p>Greetings fellow XiVO fans, it is my pleasure to announce the release of XiVO 16.03.</p>
<h2>New features in this sprint</h2>
<p><strong>REST API:</strong> A new API for associating a device with a line has been added. Devices can now be fully provisioned and
controlled via the REST API. This new API represents an additional step towards our long-term goal of offering a PBX
system that is more flexible, customizable and useful for third party developers.</p>
<p><strong>Switchboard Statistics</strong>: Calls that go through a switchboard will now generate statistics. Statistics provide
valuable information to managers of an organization when analyzing the amount of calls they receive. These statistics
can be consulted by downloading a CSV file.</p>
<h2>Technical Features</h2>
<p><strong>Websocketd</strong>: Connections made to websocketd can now use backends such as "xivo_user" or "ldap_user" to authenticate
themselves. These connections will only receive events that they are authorized to see.</p>
<p><strong>Service discovery</strong>: xivo-dird and xivo-agentd now register their services via consul.</p>
<p><strong>LDAP authentication</strong>: After discussions with members of the community, the LDAP plugin has been rewritten in order to
adapt more easily to the needs of our users. We have also added these new features:</p>
<ul>
<li>The plugin can optionally be configured to find a user via an LDAP search</li>
<li>The attributes used for matching a user's username and email are configurable</li>
</ul>
<h2>Security Advisory</h2>
<p>A security bug has been fixed in this sprint. Security advisories for vulnerable versions of XiVO
can be consulted on the <a href="http://mirror.xivo.io/security">security advisory page</a></p>
<h2>Ongoing features</h2>
<p><strong>REST API</strong>: We are working on new APIs for managing a users's call services and call forwards. This will offer third
parties more flexibility when developing applications that manage a user's services.</p>
<p><strong>Web applications</strong>: Work on tools for connecting web applications to XiVO is ongoing. A good example of a Web application is a switchboard application, where the operator may answer, hold and transfer calls from his browser, effectively controlling his physical phone. This may also be coupled with a WebRTC softphone, in order to have a full Web switchboard environment.</p>

      <p>Hello,</p>
<h2>New features in this sprint</h2>
<p><strong>Users import</strong>: The CSV import of users now supports setting the call permissions for each user. Call permissions define which restriction are put on users regarding which numbers they can dial.</p>
<p><strong>XiVO Client</strong>: All communications between the CTI server and the XiVO Clients will now be encrypted by default.</p>
<p><strong>LDAP authentication</strong>: The LDAP authentication mechanisms now uses the new user field for email address, and is not considered experimental anymore. However, it only supports simple LDAP hierarchies, and we are going to improve it to be more flexible.</p>
<h2>Technical Features</h2>
<p><strong>Asterisk upgrade</strong>: Asterisk has been upgraded from version 13.7.0 to 13.7.2</p>
<h2>Ongoing features</h2>
<p><strong>Security</strong>: We are extending the permission system to all REST APIs. This will allow a finer grained access to the REST APIs and reduce the chances of accidentally breaking the rest of the system. For example, users will be able to modify their function keys, without having access to the function keys of other users.</p>
<p><strong>REST API</strong>: We are working on a new REST API for associating devices with SIP or SCCP accounts.</p>
<p><strong>Web applications</strong>: We are working towards making Web applications connected to XiVO possible. The two things it needs is REST APIs, which are growing more useful, and events, which will be provided via Websockets, introduced in this sprint. A good example of a Web application is a switchboard application, where the operator may answer, hold and transfer calls from his browser, effectively controlling his physical phone. This may also be coupled with a WebRTC softphone, in order to have a full Web switchboard environment.</p>
<p><strong>Switchboard</strong>: We are changing the internals of the Switchboard feature so that we can control more precisely how calls are answered, transferred, etc.</p>

  <div>
      <p>Greetings fellow XiVO fans, I am pleased to announce the release of XiVO 16.01.</p>
<h2>New features in this sprint</h2>
<p><strong>XiVO Client Authentication</strong>: The XiVO client can use LDAP authentication for connecting to the XiVO server. This
makes it easier for administrators to reuse services that manage their user accounts, such as Active Directory. LDAP
authentication is managed by a new authentication backend configurable via the CTI. This backend requires manual
configuration on the server. Further details can be obtained in the upgrade notes.</p>
<p><strong>XiVO Client Connections</strong>: The XiVO client will issue a warning when it is unable to connect to the server using an
encrypted connection. Users will have the option of reconnecting to the server using an unencrypted connection.
Encrypted connections can be reactivated by clicking on the lock in the client's configuration window.</p>
<p><strong>SIP:</strong> A new tab has been added to the page for configuring advanced options in SIP accounts. Advanced options can be
added via the "advanced" tab on the lines page. These parameters will be included along side the rest of the SIP
configuration in Asterisk. The advanced tab offers more flexibility to advanced users of Asterisk, while still keeping
the rest of the UI simple enough for regular users.</p>
<p><strong>Web Interface:</strong> A few minor improvements have been added to the web interface's UI:</p>
<ul>
<li>A search bar has been added to the context page</li>
<li>The user's extension will now be displayed next to his name in multiselect boxes</li>
<li>The line associated to a device can be edited by clicking on its number in the device list</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>REST API:</strong> A new API for managing "custom" endpoints has been added. Custom endpoints enable the use of communication
protocols that are supported by Asterisk but not fully managed by XiVO, such as DAHDI cards. This new API represents an
additional step towards our long-term goal of offering a PBX system that is more flexible, customizable and useful for
third party developers.</p>
<h2>Technical Features</h2>
<p><strong>Snom phones:</strong> The plugin for Snom phones has been upgraded to version 8.7.5.35 of the firmware.</p>
<p><strong>DAHDI upgrade:</strong> DAHDI has been upgraded to version 2.11</p>
<p><strong>Consul upgrade:</strong> Consul has been upgraded to version 0.6.3</p>
<p><strong>Asterisk upgrade:</strong> Asterisk has been upgraded to version 13.7.0</p>
<p><strong>Web account ACLs</strong>: The permission system used for web service accounts has been replaced by Access Control Lists
(ACL). ACLs are a part of our ongoing work on our new permission system. This system improves security in XiVO for
various subsystems, such as communication between services. In the long term, ACLs will also permit users to access
parts of in a restricted mode, giving them the possibility of customizing different features without impacting other
parts of the system.</p>
<p><strong>CTI protocol version</strong>: The CTI protocol has been upgraded to 2.0. XiVO Clients will issue a warning when connecting
to a server that uses a version of the protocol that is incompatible with the current version of the client.</p>
<h2>Ongoing features</h2>
<p><strong>REST API:</strong> We will be working on a new API for associating devices with SIP or SCCP accounts.</p>
<p><strong>Switchboard:</strong> We are changing the internals of the Switchboard feature so that we can control more precisely how
calls are answered, transferred, etc.</p>
