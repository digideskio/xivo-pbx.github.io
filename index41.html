<p>It was a great pleasure to present the XiVO IPBX OpenHardware project at
SolutionsLinux2010 (the largest Linux fair in France yearly) on last
week and we had several discussions about the architecture choosen for
the IPBX and the interfaces / functionnalities.</p>
<p>We had some great feedbacks from different VoIP projects and deployment
feedbacks that will help us understand the needs from the market.</p>
<p>The next steps are now for the OpenHardware community, to present our
prototyping feddbacks and the detailed architecture that we are
targeting.</p>
<p>Finally, we will presenting soon the work done on the potential

    <p>
      Posted on Thu 25 February 2010 in <a href="http://blog.xivo.io/category/hardware.html">Hardware</a>
    </p>
  </header>
  <div>
      <p>Following the previous posts about the "open" bootloaders available to
improve and implement advanced features at the boot of your SoC/CPU, we
are, in this post, considering Barebox (formely known as u-boot v2) as
another open bootloader. Barebox aims at giving the developer and
embedded users the best of u-boot (space, easy-to-flash, handy tools)
and the best of the Linux kernel (Kconfig, Kbuild, standards C API,
building methods identical to the kernel with ARCH/CROSS primitives...).</p>
<p>The latest documentation for barebox can be found here <a href="2" title="2">2</a> and
lists the different key features of barebox that can listed as followed:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A posix based file API</strong>: inside barebox the usual
    open/close/read/write/lseek functions are used. This makes it
    familiar to everyone who has programmed under unix systems.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->

<ul>
<li><strong>Usual shell commands</strong> like ls/cd/mkdir/echo/cat,...</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->

<ul>
<li><strong>The environment is a file store</strong>. It has currently some
    limitations, of course. The environment is not a real read/write
    filesystem, it is more like a tar archive, or even more like an ar
    archive, because it cannot handle directories. The saveenv command
    saves the files under a certain directory (by default /env) in
    persistent storage (by default /dev/env0). There is a counterpart
    called loadenv, too.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->

<ul>
<li><strong>Real filesystem support</strong>: The loader starts up with mounting a
    ramdisk on /. Then a devfs is mounted on /dev allowing the user (or
    shell commands) to access devices. Apart from these two filesystems
    there is currently one filesystem ported: cramfs. One can mount it
    with the usual mount command.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->

<ul>
<li><strong>Device/driver model</strong>: Devices are no longer described by defines
    in the config file. Instead there are devices which can be
    registered in the board .c file or dynamically allocated. Drivers
    will match upon the devices automatically.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->

<ul>
<li><strong>Clocksource support</strong>: Timekeeping has been simplified by the use
    of the Linux clocksource API. Only one function is needed for a new
    board, no <a href="gs" title="gs">gs</a>et_timer<a href="masked" title="masked">masked</a>() or
    reset_timer<a href="masked" title="masked">masked</a>() functions.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->

<ul>
<li><strong>Kconfig and Kernel build system</strong>: Only targets which are really
    needed get recompiled. Parallel builds are no problem anymore. This
    also removes the need for many many ifdefs in the code.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->

<ul>
<li><strong>Simulation target</strong>: barebox can be compiled to run under Linux.
    While this is rather useless in real world this is a great debugging
    and development aid. New features can be easily developped and
    tested on long train journeys and started under gdb. There is a
    console driver for linux which emulates a serial device and a tap
    based ethernet driver. Linux files can be mapped to devices under
    barebox to emulate storage devices.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->

<ul>
<li><strong>Device parameter support</strong>: Each device can have a unlimited
    number of parameters. They can be accessed on the command line with
    &lt;devid&gt;.&lt;param&gt;="...", for example 'eth0.ip=192.168.0.7'
    or 'echo \$eth0.ip'</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->

<ul>
<li><strong>Initcalls</strong>: Hooks in the startup process can be archieved
    with *_initcall() directives in each file.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->

<ul>
<li><strong>Getopt</strong>: There is a small getopt implementation. Some commands
    got really complicated (both in code and in usage) due to the fact
    that U-Boot only allowed positional parameters.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->

<ul>
<li>Editor: Scripts can be edited with a small editor.</li>
</ul>
<p>Barebox is under GPLv2 licence.</p>

      <p>This series of posts are dedicated to the different opensource
bootloaders available out-there that are or can be used for OpenHardware
project such as the XiVO IPBX we are currently developping.</p>
<p>This second post on the bootloaders available will present U-boot, one
the widely used bootloader for embedded systems. <strong>U-boot stands for
''Das Unterseeboot"</strong> meaning "the submarine" in German and it's also
known as "Das U-Boot -- the Universal Boot Loader".</p>
<p>U-boot is currently supporting a vast range of architectures such as:
including PPC, ARM, AVR32, MIPS, x86, 68k, Nios, and MicroBlaze
(soft-core for Xilinx FPGAs).</p>
<p>The main advantages of the different OpenSource bootloader solutions are
that they allow "userspace" features at the boot such as: interactive
commands (CLI type usually), environment variables(IP, PATH, R/W
permissions...), command scripting(typically shell scripts - namely used
in uboot-v2 a.k.a. barebox and that we will cover in the next post) and
booting from external media (or network fot TFTP rootfs and images
updates for example).</p>
<p>Einfochips <a href="1" title="1">1</a> provides a great documentation guide on how to
port uboot to a new architecture / platform with a stress on the
different files provided by u-boot and the cross-compilation issue for
the targetted platform/board/cpu.</p>
<p>Usually u-boot is stored (i.e. resides in the beginning memory area of
the flash - internal to the CPU or external-flash) in the beginning area
of the flash. This memory address (sector or block) is defined by by the
board for the very early stage of the boot (in board/xxx/init.S). The
start-up code of the processor is then defined (in cpu/arch/start.S -
like in cpu/bf533/start.S for the Blackfin processor). The boot sequence
symbols are usually noticeable as they are prefixed like "_start".</p>
<p>First stage loader: U-boot initializes the CPU and the different
peripherals on the board to allows to jump the the memory (DRAM)
subsystems. The processor core is designed to fetch instructions
starting from _START_ADDRESS_ . The core then attempts to execute the
instructions found here. Because this is the top of the memory range,
the instruction found here must be an unconditional branch instruction.
This core has to be hard-coded to configure the upper memory region so
that it is accessible without programming the external bus controller,
to which Flash memory is usually attached. This forces the requirement
to branch to a location within this address space because the processor
is incapable of addressing memory anywhere else until our bootloader
code initializes additional memory regions.</p>
<p>Second stage loader: U-boot loads itself in the RAM (SDRAM, NVRAM in the
CPU RAM or external RAM) and receives the command to boot the kernel
image. The kernel image is then uncompressed, u-boot loads it to the
memory and gives control to the kernel. The kernel will continue the
execution without u-boot.</p>
<p>This post is just a first description of U-boot and we will get more
details for specific architectures with x86 platform that we are
targetting for the XiVO IPBX project.</p>

      <p>The OpenHardware community had been seeking for more and more openess
lately in the hardware side, as well as in the software side. We see
more and more steps forward of the software side into the configuration
of the hardware (i.e. HDL projects for reconfigurable hardware such as
FPGAs and CPLDs) to reduce the constraints coming from the hardware
configuration.</p>
<p>The hardware part is composed of the schematics, pcb routing files,
gerber production files to enable the open description and output of the
features.</p>
<p>The software part is roughly composed of the bootloader (allowing the
CPU/SoC/uController to boot the memory controller and enable the
peripherals) which will indicate the memory address of the kernel.</p>
<p>In-between the hardware and the software part of the device, the
bootloader is definitely a important "glue" that should be also open to
allow users to implement their own peripherals initialization and boot
optimization of the kernel. For CPU architecture and namely x86
architecture, the booloader also known as the BIOS had been a closed
industry for quite a long time with companies such as American Trends
providing the boot sequence we all know on our PC-environment. The only
options we could have from this BIOS interface are mainly: boot
sequence, CPU frequency clocking, IRQs configuration and some memory
mappings. "Open BIOS" are then a dream of x86-based OpenHardware
projects and coreboot seems now mature enough to make this future true.</p>
<p>Previously known as LinuxBIOS, coreboot <a href="1" title="1">1</a> is a GPL project
developing an OpenSource BIOS firmware for a various number of platforms
and architecture. As we post this message, coreboot is supporting 213
different mainboards.The different supported mainboards "table of
hardware" are available
here:http://www.coreboot.org/Supported_MotherboardsThe different
chipsets supported are listed in 5 categories: north bridge (fast data
bridge), south bridge(slow data bridge), super I/Os chipsets, CPUs (x86,
PowerPC and emulated QEMU CPUs) and SoCs (AMD Elan SC520 and Intel
Tolapai EP 80579). This list is available
here:http://www.coreboot.org/Supported_Chipsets_and_DevicesThe
different payloads (that we could name also as "second stage loader")
such as the bootloaders and the kernels mainly are listed
here:http://www.coreboot.org/Payloads</p>
<p>Coreboot is now available in version 3 and provide features such as:
express boot sequence (3s to linux console, advanced network booting,
peripherals advanced support.</p>
<p>We will test Coreboot v3 on the targetted x86-based CPU chosen for the
XiVO OpenHardware IPBX and give documentation and feedbacks on the usage
feasability for this appliance in upcoming posts as well as describing
with more details the battle to open the bootloaders (once you open the
bootloader you allow the hardware hackers to play with your device
definitely).</p>

      <p>As the XiVO OpenHardware IPBX will be using 4 T0 ISDN lines, it's
important to present and educate reader on how works ISDN lines for IPBX
usage. As the telecommunications world (POTS, PSTN, GSM, ISDN, ADSL) and
the TCP/IP world are now merged into the networks we daily use, we see a
great difference between the knowledge and education of people on the
TCP/IP standards (widely used, massively understood and fine-tuned) and
the telecommunications standards and namely the ISDN (Integrated
Services Digital Network) interfaces used in PBX, IPBX or GSM networks
(E1 lines usually as used in OpenBSC project).</p>
<p>The <strong>ISDN line</strong> is a circuit-switched telephone network system
implemented on ordinary telephony copper wires on the PSTN/POTS network
to carry digital data and digital voice. The line interface is a
four-wire interface and has separated transmitter and receiver with
configurable behaviour. Every line can be switched either into S/T (four
wires - double pair) or Up (two wires - single pair) mode separately. R,
S/T and U(or Up) mode are named like this by the ITU after their current
order on the ISDN hook-up.</p>
<p>The standard ISDN line/hookup architecture looks like:</p>
<p><img alt="ISDN Hookup overview
architecture" src="/public/.ISDN_1_m.jpg" title="ISDN Hookup overview architecture, fév. 2010" /></p>
<p>TE: Terminal Equipment</p>
<p>TA: Terminal Adapter</p>
<p>NT: Network Terminator</p>
<p>S/T: Usually using 4-wires (2 pairs)</p>
<p>U: Usually using 2-wires (1 pair)</p>
<p>This overview architecture represents the standardized view of and ISDN
architecture. Operators either provide U interfaces (2-wire long
distance; the variants for interconnection to a public network are
called U0 and Uk0) or S/T interfaces (this is typically a by-country
alternative). In the latter case, a Network Termination owned by the
operator is typically installed in the customer premises because the S/T
bus is limited to a few hundred meters. If the operator provides U
interfaces, the customer can still connect its own Network Termination
and use an S/T interface behind it, or alternatively directly connect an
equipment that supports U interfaces. For private direct ISDN
connections up to a few kilometers, the 2 wire Up (Up0/UpN) interface
also exists.</p>
<p>The Universal <strong>ISDN port</strong> is developed according to the ITU-T.430 and
ETSI TBR 003 standards. It consists of the receive and transmit data
pathes with a clock processing unit each, the clock distribution unit.
The block diagram for a standard ISDN port module looks like:</p>
<p><img alt="ISDN Universal ISDN Port
Module" src="/public/.ISDN_2_m.jpg" title="ISDN Universal ISDN Port Module, fév. 2010" /></p>
<p>TE Mode: Terminal Equipment mode, the TE is always taken as
synchronisation source for ISDN applications (like the CLK is delivered
from the Central Office Switch).</p>
<p>NT Mode: Network Terminator mode, the NT mode 192kHz bit clock and the
8kHz frame clock are derived from FSYNC.</p>
<p>The ISDN line port is based on 3 layers following different standards:</p>
<p>•Layer 1: ITU-T I.430</p>
<p>•Layer 2: ITU-T Q.920, ITU-T Q.921</p>
<p>•Layer 3: ITU-T Q.930 and ITU-T Q.931</p>
<p>At the layer 1, the line is based on the <strong>BRI (Basic Rate Interface)</strong>
which delivers 144kbits/s (for S/T mode) broken into two 64kbits/s B
(Bearer) channel for data and one 16kbits/s D (Delta) channel for
signaling. The overhead is then added to the 144kbits/s (for a total of
196kbits/s) due to Frame Synchronization, Echo Channel (echo of the
D-channel received in NT mode to detect collision on the TX for the
D-channel when the S/T bus is shared) and Electrical Balancing bits. BRI
are popular in Europe and Japan. The B-channel uses a standard 64 kbit/s
datarate voice channel of 8 bits sampled at 8 kHz with G.711 encoding.
B-Channels can also be used to carry data, since they are nothing more
than digital channels. T0 (or S0) refers then to a BRI ISDN line
provided by the carrier to connect the IPBX to the public network.</p>
<p>The raw interface available with BRI is called T0 (in Europe). Some ISDN
carriers provide S0 interface (like the Duo/Itoo service in France for
several end-devices that can communicate between each other).In France,
the "Numeris" service provides a TNR (Terminaison Numerique de Reseau
with device such as the Sagem TNR IPS 4G) end-device that does the
conversion between the U interface and the T interface. The TNA
(Terminaison Numerique d'Abonne) does the conversion between the T
interface and the S interface. In most countries, except North-America,
the carrier provides the TNR end-device and the TNA device is provided
by the end-user customer (usually the PBX interface).</p>
<p><strong>PRI (Primary Rate Interface)</strong> are more popular in North American ISDN
carriers,</p>
<p>In Europe we see PRI E1 lines carrying 30 B-channels and 1 D-channel
(2048 kbits/s)</p>
<p>In North-America, we see PRI T1 lines carrying 23 B-channels and 1
D-channel (1544 kbits/s).</p>
<p>Japan also has PRI J1 lines similar to T1 lines with 23-B+1-D.</p>
<p>The ISDN controller chip on the hardware will be connected to the CPU
through two buses (SPI bus to control the chip and transmit D-channel
from the CPU and the PCM (also named TDM bus) bus to transmit D-channels
data with the ISDN lines). The number of simultaneous calls then had to
be calculated with the choice of the ISDN capability and the codec used
on those ones.</p>
<p>This blog post aims at giving an overview of the ISDN interface used on
the IPBX and namely in the XiVO Hardware in order to understand the
hardware project as well as the protocols used into XiVo Hardware.</p>
