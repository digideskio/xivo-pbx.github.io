    <p>Well. Yes. provd ask a "device info extractor" object to extract
information from the HTTP request, and that object returns the
information we were expecting. But what is really happening inside that
"device info extractor" ? Let's see:</p>
<p><a href="/public/provd/provd-dev-info-extraction-details.png" title="Device info extraction details"><img alt="Device info extraction
details" src="/public/provd/.provd-dev-info-extraction-details_m.jpg" title="Device info extraction details, fÃ©v. 2012" /></a></p>
<p>The device info extractor object is in fact only merging results from
two others device info extractor.</p>
<p>The "all plugins device info extractor" ask for each installed plugin to
extract info from the request. In this case, thexivo-aastra plugin is of
course able to extract a lot of information by looking at the User-Agent
header, but the xivo-cisco-sccp plugin is of no help. The results are
then merged and returned.</p>
<p>The "standard device info extractor" extract the IP address. It's role
is to only extract trivial information from requests.</p>
<p>From what we learned, we can deduce some properties of device
information extraction in provd.</p>
<p>First, if no plugins are installed, only IP addresses will ever be
extracted.</p>
<p>Next, we can ask ourselves what happens when two plugins returns
different information. Well, the "all plugins device info extractor" is
capable of applying different merge strategies. I won't go into more
details for now.</p>
<p>The last thing we can see is that a bad plugin could make the system
unreliable. You do not want to be in the situation were wrong
information is extracted by a plugin. That is why it's always safer to
only install the plugins you need, and no more.</p>
<p>Now that we know all that, let's see what happens for a request coming
from a Cisco 7940. One of the first request it does is:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>TFTP RRQ SEP554433221100.cnf.xml
</pre></div>


<p>TFTP requests are really simple, especially if you compare them to HTTP
requests. The only interesting information an RRQ (read request) can
have is the filename. But a filename can contains a lot of information.</p>
<p>TFTP requests take a similar flow as HTTP requests in provd. In our
example, the xivo-aastra plugin will return no information from it, but
the xivo-cisco-sccp plugin will be able to extract both the vendor and
the MAC address. For this request, it's not possible to determine the
model nor the firmware version.</p>
<p>So provd knows the request came from a Cisco, and that its MAC address
is 55:44:33:22:11:00. That's not much, but it's better than nothing.</p>
<p>That said, there is a special trick for extracting information about the
model on Cisco 7900 phones. I won't tell you what it is because I'm
getting tired of writing this article, but all I can say is that it's
pretty neat, and it's also useful in some other situation. Well okay,
I'll just say the name: DHCP integration.</p>
<p>That's all folks. We have both seen the best (Aastra 6731i) and the
worst (Cisco 7940) case concerning device info extraction in provd. That
said, even the worst case doesn't pose a real problem. Next time, if I
don't get too many death threat following this article, I'll talk about
the next step of request processing in provd, device retrieving, which
is quite simpler by the way.</p>
