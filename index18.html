    <h2><a href="http://blog.xivo.io/upgrading-xivo-with-xivo-upgrade.html#upgrading-xivo-with-xivo-upgrade">Upgrading XiVO with \"xivo-upgrade\"</a></h2>
    <p>
      Posted on Thu 29 March 2012 in <a href="http://blog.xivo.io/category/software.html">Software</a>
    </p>

  <div>
      <p>In XiVO version 1.2.2, a new package has been introduced, xivo-upgrade.
This new script must be usedto make sure that upgrades are completed
properly. The objective is to minimize differences between machinesand
to control the environment in case of problems.</p>
<p>We had many problems to work around:</p>
<ul>
<li>questions to answer about replacing packaged files that have been
    modified</li>
<li>reload services when libraries are modified</li>
<li>modify the database schema when needed</li>
<li>showing the current and new version when upgrading</li>
</ul>
<p>We decided to put this system in place to keep upgrades simples and
transparent to the end ~~user~~ admin.The goal being to stay as SIMPLE
as possible!</p>
<p>Too many people are stressed by their IPBX upgrades!<img alt="Stress
Man" src="/public/human_pro/.file0001382919230_s.jpg" title="Stress Man, mar. 2012" /></p>
<p>But not with
XiVO!<img alt="Congratulation" src="/public/human_pro/.file6741271974648_s.jpg" title="Congratulation, mar. 2012" /></p>
<p>No one should be afraid of the side effects of an upgrade!</p>
<h2>Technical informations</h2>
<p>This package allows the administrator to upgrade his XiVO securely and
in a way validated by the dev team.The script executes many steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>xivo-upgrade upgrade, to get the latest modifications to the upgrade
    process</li>
<li>
<p>Upgrade confirmation if upgrades are available:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the answer is NO, the upgrade is aborted</li>
<li>If the answer is YES, the script continues to the next step</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pre-upgrade scripts are run.</p>
</li>
<li>XiVO is upgraded</li>
<li>Post-upgrade scripts are executed.</li>
<li>All XiVO services are restarted in the right order.</li>
</ol>
<p>Package architecture:</p>
<p>Binaries:</p>
<ul>
<li>xivo-upgrade (Update xivo-upgrade package and
    execute real-xivo-upgrade)</li>
<li>real-xivo-upgrade (Execute upgrade of XiVO and restart services)</li>
</ul>
<p>Libraries path: /usr/share/xivo-upgrade/</p>
<p>Directories:</p>
<ul>
<li>pre-upgrade.d (All files in this directory will be executed before
    upgrading XiVO)</li>
<li>post-upgrade.d (All files in this directory will be executed after
    XiVO upgrade)</li>
</ul>
<p>Current post-install scripts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Update template for device configuration.</li>
<li>Update all device configurations to integrate the backup_proxy_ip
    from the HA configuration.</li>
<li>Set default web-interface language to english.</li>
</ul>

    <h2><a href="http://blog.xivo.io/xivo-high-availability.html#xivo-high-availability">XiVO high availability</a></h2>
    <p>
      Posted on Wed 14 March 2012 in <a href="http://blog.xivo.io/category/articles.html">articles</a>
    </p>
  </header>
  <div>
      <p>High availability is available in XiVO since version 1.2.3. The current
use cases is to be able to get telephony service back in less than 5
minutes in case of a network or power failure on the master XiVO.</p>
<p>The architecture is pretty simple at the time of this writing. The
configuration database is replicated every hours to a slave XiVO. The
slave XiVO pings the master XiVO every 30 seconds and launches asterisk
if the master is down. The slave will also stop asterisk if the master
is turned back up. The check (a ping) is pretty simple at the moment,
this means that a fail-over will not happen if asterisk or any other
service has crashed, monit should be able to restart the crashed service
in most cases anyway.</p>
<p>To enable this feature, go to <em>Configuration, High availability</em>. Choose
master node on the master and enter the slave's IP address in the remote
address field. On the slave, choose slave node and enter the master's IP
address in the remote address field.</p>
<p><img alt="ha_master.png" src="/public/.ha_master_m.jpg" title="ha_master.png, mar. 2012" /></p>
<p>There is no way to trigger a synchronization between master and slave
from the web interface, a work around is to launch
xivo-master-slave-db-replication &lt;slave-ip&gt; on the master XiVO.
This might be useful if you just finished your configuration and want to
trigger a first replication or for test purposes.</p>
<p>Some limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>This solution uses the backup registrar from the phones, see the
    <a href="http://documentation.xivo.fr" title="documentation">documentation</a> for
    supported phones.</li>
<li>Voice mail messages are not replicated between master and slave. A
    solution is to attach the message and to mail it in the notification
    and delete the message from the server when high availability
    is enabled.</li>
<li>CEL are not replicated between master and slave. Calls on the slave
    are logged on the slave and calls on the master are logged on
    the master.</li>
</ul>

    <h2><a href="http://blog.xivo.io/around-xivo-pxe-server-setup.html#around-xivo-pxe-server-setup">Around XiVO - pxe server setup</a></h2>
    <p>
      Posted on Thu 01 March 2012 in <a href="http://blog.xivo.io/category/software.html">Software</a>
      &#8226; Tagged with
      <a href="http://blog.xivo.io/tag/pxe.html">PXE</a>    </p>
  </header>
  <div>
      <p>This is the second part of the description of the XiVO installation
process.</p>
<p>I'm going to describe how to setup a simple pxe server.</p>
<p>You need to have 2 services enabled on your server, dhcp and tftp.</p>
<p>Dhcp is used to give ip parameters to join the tftp server from the
client,the tftp server serves the files needed to install a debian
system.</p>
<p>On debian system, you have to install isc-dhcp-server, here is a
minimaldhcp configuration:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>#/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf
ddns-update-style none;
option domain-name &quot;mydomain.com&quot;;
option domain-name-servers 10.10.32.1;
default-lease-time 600;
max-lease-time 7200;
log-facility local7;
subnet 10.10.32.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
    range 10.10.32.10 10.10.32.20;
    option routers 10.10.32.1;
    next-server 10.10.32.1;
    option tftp-server-name &quot;10.10.32.1&quot;;
    filename &quot;pxelinux.0&quot;;
}
</pre></div>


<p>You can test your dhcp configuration by booting a machine on pxe to
ensurethat the dhcp configuration is functionnal :</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>Mar  1 13:44:16 arkham dhcpd: DHCPDISCOVER from 52:54:00:d3:44:27 via br1
   Mar  1 13:44:17 arkham dhcpd: DHCPOFFER on 10.10.32.10 to 52:54:00:d3:44:27 via br1
   Mar  1 13:44:17 arkham dhcpd: DHCPDISCOVER from 52:54:00:d3:44:27 via br1
   Mar  1 13:44:17 arkham dhcpd: DHCPOFFER on 10.10.32.10 to 52:54:00:d3:44:27 via br1
   Mar  1 13:44:19 arkham dhcpd: DHCPREQUEST for 10.10.32.10 (10.10.32.1) from 52:54:00:d3:44:27 via br1
   Mar  1 13:44:19 arkham dhcpd: DHCPACK on 10.10.32.10 to 52:54:00:d3:44:27 via br1
</pre></div>


<p>Now we have to install and configure a tftp server, we're going to
installtftpd-hpa. You have to install debian-installer-4.0-netboot-i386
too. Thispackage provide all the files used to install a fresh debian
system by pxe.</p>
<p>You have to modify tftp_directory on /etc/default/tftpd-hpa:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>TFTP_DIRECTORY=&quot;/usr/lib/debian-installer/images/i386/text&quot;
</pre></div>


<p>and restart the tftp server to apply your modification.</p>
<p>You have to edit 2 files to finish your configuration: menu.cfg and
syslinux.cfg</p>
<p>You have to modify include and default path in boot-screens/syslinux.cfg</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre># D-I config version 2.0
   include boot-screens/menu.cfg
   default boot-screens/vesamenu.c32
   prompt 0
   timeout 0
</pre></div>


<p>You have to add to boot-screens/menu.cfg</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>label squeeze-i386
       menu label squeeze i386
       kernel linux
       append vga=normal initrd=initrd.gz
</pre></div>


<p>You can now test your modification by booting a computer on your subnet,
herethe screen that you should view if your configuration is ok</p>
<p><img alt="pxe_screen.png" src="/public/pxe_screen.png" title="pxe_screen.png, mar. 2012" /></p>
<p>In the next post, I will explain an advanced pxe configuration and how
to usepreseeding to execute an automatic installation.</p>

    <h2><a href="http://blog.xivo.io/sccpp-and-continuous-integration.html#sccpp-and-continuous-integration">SCCPp and continuous integration</a></h2>
    <p>
      Posted on Mon 20 February 2012 in <a href="http://blog.xivo.io/category/software.html">Software</a>
    </p>
  </header>
  <div>
      <p>SCCPp is a small tool that we developed in parallel of our Asterisk sccp
channel. Its main purpose is to imitate a real cisco phone in a pure
virtual way. One of the main goal behind it is to be able to do
continuous integration. By coupling SCCPp with Asterisk testsuite and
Jenkins we are able to automate tests that we would normally do
manually. This way, when a commit is pushed, it trigger a task that
launch the script responsible to update and compile the source, to pass
every test in the list and to report if something went wrong.</p>
<p>Only basic test are implemented via SCCPp at the present moment. We can
simulate the full protocol exchange involved when a phone connect and
authenticate itself to the server. Another supported option is the
stress test of a configured device. In this mode, SCCPp start two
threads and dial the device at random interval. The goal here is to pass
through as much code as possible and to make sure there is no regression
in the code under known scenarios.</p>
<p>SCCPp doesn't support the RTP protocol (Real-Time Transport Protocol) at
the present moment. What it mean is that we can't simulate the
transportation of the voice from a device to another. The development of
SCCPp is still at an early stage, and many more features will be added
in the future.</p>
<p>As the complexity of the libsccp increase, we need more tests to ensure
that a change in the code, such a bug fix, do not introduce new faults.
Functional testing is only one part of the solution, even if it's a
powerful one to ensure that specific cases work well, it says nothing
about the internal. The other half of the solution is to unit test the
code. This is a method by which individual units of source code are
tested to ensure they perform properly. Fortunately, Asterisk has its
own framework that allow us to easily write unit test and to trigger
them to see if they pass correctly. In another post, we will present
what can be done with this Asterisk unit test framework and how it can
help to do TDD (Test Driven Development).</p>
<p>If you are interested to play with SCCPp, you can get the source code at
this address:

    <h2><a href="http://blog.xivo.io/xivo-12.html#xivo-12">XiVO 1.2</a></h2>
    <p>
      Posted on Tue 14 February 2012 in <a href="http://blog.xivo.io/category/articles.html">articles</a>

  <div>
      <p>As we enter 2012, we continue our development to better meet market
expectations allowing XiVO to be deployed in more companies. XiVO is a
real open and free alternative for your business phone system and it
will allow you to go even further. It is with great pleasure that I
announce the arrival of this new major release of XiVO which is also our
last considering that our development model is replaced by the agile
methodology (SCRUM).</p>
<p>Why do we change ?</p>
<p>Just because we want to be closer to your requests, be able to stand
out, constantly innovate and for this we need a new vision of
development. It's been several months since we changed our habits, our
ways of building software, our vision of what a software is and we will
continue in that direction. We still have a long way to go but it only
makes XiVO better for everyone.</p>
<p><img alt="xivo-web-1-2.png" src="/public/.xivo-web-1-2_m.jpg" title="xivo-web-1-2.png, fév. 2012" /></p>
<p>In this new release we have upgraded the operating system from Lenny to
Squeeze, updated Asterisk by installing and using the last “Long Term
Supported” 1.8 version. These major changes are not only naturally
bringing us a bunch of new native functionalities but also better
performance and stability.</p>
<p>Regarding XiVO, we reviewed our provisioning server which was designed
at the beginning of XiVO and was not suited any more to the big
architectures we are targeting.</p>
<p>We have refreshed the web interface in terms of functionality and
ergonomics to meet the new functionalities provided by Asterisk. We also
changed the way configuration is done by using a new server dedicated to
configuration management.</p>
<p>The news also made us realize that we were not sure where we go with
mysql and we chose to use Postgres as a basis to save our
configurations.TDM card drivers are also updated when this new release
is installed.</p>
<p>CTI server and XiVO client were also mainly rewritten and refactored.</p>
<p>With this new release we also started to work on refactoring some
features which are not delivered now any more. At first, high
availability and contact center are our current priorities and will be
offered in the next coming releases.Our development method is based on
short iterations of 2 weeks, which will produce a finished and working
product. So every 2 weeks a new release is produced and you will be able
to upgrade and enjoy bug fixes and new features. Do not hesitate to
follow http://projects.xivo.fr and http://documentation.xivo.fr/ to get
a better view.</p>
<p>We will go through our process in more details in a later post to
describe what we have set up in term of tests, documentation, bug
tracking etc ....</p>
