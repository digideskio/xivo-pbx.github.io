      <p>From XiVO 1.2.5 we started to integrate the SCCP management directly
into the web interface.It means that now, people installing a XiVO
server can natively use the SCCP technologywhen creating new lines,
without the need to manually install the sccp channel driver andediting
the configuration file. As the sccp library evolve, the options
available throughthe web interface will also be expanded.</p>
<p>Lately we've been working on the multi-instance per line, which will be
released with XiVO 1.2.7 this week.Basically the multi-instance per line
is the ability to receive or make many calls at the same time.While only
one call can be active at a time, it is possible to keep the other call
alive but on hold.You can then toggle between the calls to pickup any of
them. Which will put the current active call on hold,and will set the
selected call as active.</p>
<p><a href="/public/libsccp/IMG_20120501_092831.jpg" title="7960-multi-instance1"><img alt="7960-multi-instance1" src="/public/libsccp/.IMG_20120501_092831_s.jpg" title="7960-multi-instance1, mai 2012" /></a></p>
<p>We still have a long list of features we want to write and make
available directly through XiVO.Even though we are still in early
development, I encourage everyone that have CISCO phones to installand
try the SCCP library. Either via XiVO or by manually installing the sccp
channel driver.</p>
<p>For those having CISCO phones that use the SCCP technology, we've put
online a tutorial to help you get this done:
<a href="http://documentation.xivo.fr/dev/administration/sccp/sccp.html">http://documentation.xivo.fr/dev/administration/sccp/sccp.html</a></p>
<p>At the bottom of the tutorial, you will also find the list of feature
and telephone type that we actually support.We hope to extend this list
as time goes, but we need your help !</p>
<p>At this point of development, we need more people that use the SCCP
library. As the number of people using itwill increase, the number of
bugs reported will increase and hence the number of fix and enhancement.
At the end, everbody win.</p>

      <p>Last September we started to change our development methodology to use
SCRUM.</p>
<p>The main objective was to be able to deliver very quickly new XiVO
versions.Our sprints are two weeks long, and at the end of a sprint we
deliver a new release of XiVO that you can use by using the new
<em>xivo-upgrade</em> tool.Every two weeks on Monday we start with the planning
meeting, where we define what will be done during the sprint. Each bug
or task is written on a post it and put on our white board.</p>
<p>Every day, at 09h00 we do our daily Scrum, small stand up meeting where
all the team members answer the three scum traditional questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What did I do since yesterday?</li>
<li>What am I planning to do today?</li>
<li>Anything blocks me ?</li>
</ul>
<p>Optionally at the end of the stand up meeting, we can start a small
technical session about software architecture, code review and now that
we moved to a bigger office, we can draw on the walls and do design
review.</p>
<p>At the middle of the second week, on Wednesday we stop our development,
finish our commits, and build the release. At this time starts the
functional testing period. Today we run more than 350 functional tests
which are described in our test manager
<a href="http://testlink.xivo.fr" title="testlink">testlink</a>. These tests are partly
automated, and one of our goal is to be able to automate more and more
tests. Furthermore, every day some of our functional tests are run
automatically using our continuous integration server
<a href="http://jenkins.xivo.fr/" title="jenkins"></a> in addition to the unit tests
covering part of XiVO software.Once the tests are ok, the delivery check
list helps us to not forget anything to be sure you will be able to
xivo-upgrade your installation without any pain.</p>
<p>Last but not least, we do our sprint retrospective to be able to find
ways to improve our process. At the end, it's time for beer !</p>
<p>Today the main point is to be able to improve XiVO strength, and to
correct and deliver very quickly any problems you may have. New features
will come the second part of 2012 once this objective will be achieved.</p>
<p>It is very encouraging to see that in 2009 it took us on average <strong>315</strong>
days to close an issue, in 2010, 295 days, in 2011, 127 days, and <strong>this
year it takes only 28 days</strong> in average to close an open issue. This is
not finish we still have a long road, but thanks to the great team
working on XiVO, things improve every day.</p>
<p>So stay tune, every two weeks you will get a new flavor of XiVO, more
and more reliable and with hopefully more and more features.</p>
<p>If you'd like to participate in this adventure do not hesitate to
contact us,<a href="http://www.avencall.com/index.php?option=com_neorecruit&amp;Itemid=15&amp;lang=en">we are looking for passionate
people</a>.</p>

  <div>
      <p>Let's take the same example as we did last time, i.e. let's say we have
a xivo-aastra plugin installed.</p>
<p>So we plug a brand new Aastra 6731i on our network. The phone then does
the following HTTP request:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nf">GET</span> <span class="nn">/Aastra/aastra.cfg</span> <span class="kr">HTTP</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1.1</span>
<span class="na">User-Agent</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="l">Aastra6731i MAC:00-11-22-33-44-55 V:3.2.2.1136-SIP</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The "device info extraction" step is then able to extract the following
information:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>{&#39;vendor&#39;: &#39;Aastra&#39;, &#39;model&#39;: &#39;6731i&#39;, &#39;version&#39;: &#39;3.2.2.1136&#39;,
 &#39;mac&#39;: &#39;00:11:22:33:44:55&#39;, &#39;ip&#39;: &#39;192.168.1.100&#39;}
</pre></div>


<p>This information is then passed to a "device retriever" object. Here's a
pseudo code version of what it looks like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>def process_request(request):
    device_info = device_info_extractor.extract(request)
    device = device_retriever.retrieve(device_info)
    ...
</pre></div>


<p>A device object can be seen as a superset of a device info object. Both
are dictionaries, but the device object can contain keys that the device
infoobject never will, like an "id", a "plugin" and a "config" key.</p>
<p>Let's see in more details what happens in this "device retriever"
object:</p>
<p><a href="/public/provd/device-retriever.png" title="Device retriever"><img alt="Device
retriever" src="/public/provd/.device-retriever_m.jpg" title="Device retriever, avr. 2012" /></a></p>
<p>The device retriever will ask one at a time the different other device
retrievers until one returns something. In our example, since the provd
serverdoesn't know yet about our Aastra, the "mac device retriever" will
returns nothing because there is no device with the MAC address
00:11:22:33:44:55 in the device database, then the "SN (serial number)
device retriever" will returns nothing because no SN is used with
Aastra, then the "ip device retriever" will also returns nothing, and
finally, the "add device retriever" will add the new device to the
database and return it.</p>
<p>On the next requests of our Aastra, the "mac device retriever" will
search for a device with the given MAC and will then return the device
object that was added previously.</p>
<p>From what we just learned, we can see that it's at this step that
devices are automatically added to provd. That said, the automatic
plugin association and automatic config association (taken from a
"template" config) is not done at this step but later on, which is
something we'll see in more details in my next blog post.</p>
<p>If provd had to support only Aastra phones, only the "mac device
retriever" and the "add device retriever" would be needed (and some part
of provd would be a whole lot simpler also). That said, the reality is
more complex. Some phones are only doing TFTP requests, which means no
User-Agent header and little information to extract for some requests,
sometimes only the IP address. This is where the "ip device retriever"
comes in handy. It's usually able to find the right device by only using
the IP address. This is possible because provd always try to maintain
the most up to date info about IP address used by devices.</p>
<p>That said, for some devices, there is some scenarios where the system
just isn't powerful enough:</p>
<ul>
<li>you power on a new Linksys/Cisco SPA3102, which is given the
    192.168.1.101 IP address by the DHCP server</li>
<li>the phone then ask the /spa3102.cfg file via TFTP</li>
<li>provd knows the request came from a Linksys SPA3102 with the
    192.168.1.101 IP address, but doesn't know the MAC address. No
    worry, it still adds it to the device database.</li>
<li>the phone then ask the /001122334477.xml file, still via TFTP.</li>
<li>provd is able to retrieve the device by using the IP address, and
    now knows that the device behind the request has the MAC
    00:11:22:33:44:77</li>
<li>the phone is unplugged from the network</li>
<li>a couple of days later, the phone is power on again. This time, the
    DHCP server gives it the 192.168.1.102 IP address</li>
<li>the phone then ask the /spa3102.cfg file via TFTP</li>
<li>the only information that can used to retrieve the device is the
    IP address. That said, no device in the device database use this
    IP address. provd will then create a new device, believing its a
    new device.</li>
<li>the phone then ask the /001122334477.xml file</li>
<li>provd is then able to retrieve the first device by using the
    MAC address. It then updates the IP address information of
    this device. Unfortunately, the previous step created a device in
    the database for nothing.</li>
</ul>
<p>The system still works in these cases. The only problem is that you get
junk devices in provd device's database, and these can only be removed
manually. They are not causing any real harm except then adding some
confusion as to why theses devices are in the database.</p>
<p>There is a way to get by this problem, and it's called "dhcp
integration". Yes. Just believe me.</p>
<p>So that's all folks. Next time, if your brain still hasn't suffered from
an epileptic seizure, get ready because we'll be talking about the
"device updating" step.</p>

    <h2><a href="http://blog.xivo.io/two-new-platforms-for-the-xivo-client.html#two-new-platforms-for-the-xivo-client">Two new platforms for the XiVO Client</a></h2>
    <p>
      Posted on Wed 04 April 2012 in <a href="http://blog.xivo.io/category/software.html">Software</a>
    </p>
  </header>
  <div>
      <p>Until now, the XiVO Client was released for only two different
platforms : Windows, Debian GNU/Linux and Ubuntu. Yes, that makes three,
but Ubuntu is based upon Debian, and the two versions do not differ.</p>
<p>However, the Qt framework that is used by the XiVO Client allows
applications to be also built for Mac OS. Furthermore, back in the 1.1
version, the XiVO Client was supported on Mac OS. We then reused the old
building script that were rotting in our Git repository and cleaned them
up to allow us to build a new Mac version of the XiVO Client.</p>
<p>Here's what it looks like :</p>
<p><a href="/public/xivosoft/xivoclient-macos.png" title="XiVO Client Mac OS"><img alt="XiVO Client Mac
OS" src="/public/xivosoft/.xivoclient-macos_m.jpg" title="XiVO Client Mac OS, avr. 2012" /></a></p>
<p>The stable version will be released at the same time as other platforms,
by the end of the week, with the XiVO 1.2.5 release.</p>
<p>For hackers who would want to play around with the XiVO Client's source
code on Mac OS (or other platforms), the instructions for building and
coding can be found here :
http://documentation.xivo.fr/dev/developers/xivo_client/xivo_client.html</p>
<p>Another big news, even though Archers are (unfortunately ;) ) a bit
fewer than Mac users, the XiVO Client package for Archlinux on the AUR
is also being restored, and will soon be available in the AUR. The two
packages already here have not been updated since last year.</p>
