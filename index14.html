    <h2><a href="http://blog.xivo.io/visualizing-asterisk-deadlocks.html#visualizing-asterisk-deadlocks">Visualizing asterisk deadlocks</a></h2>
    <p>
      Posted on Wed 24 October 2012 in <a href="http://blog.xivo.io/category/software.html">Software</a>
    </p>

  <div>
      <p>It has recently come to our attention that a freeze would sometimes
occur in the asterisk application shipped with XiVO.</p>
<p>When the freeze happened, no new calls would be accepted and most of the
current calls would freeze. A manual restart of the asterisk process
would then be required for the situation to get back to normal.</p>
<p>As you can understand, that's quite an unpleasant situation for a
telephony system like XiVO.</p>
<p>So we began investigating on what was causing the freeze, knowing it was
probably some deadlocks occuring in the asterisk process.Fortunately for
us, asterisk provides some compile time flags that help with debugging
such conditions. This is documented <a href="https://wiki.asterisk.org/wiki/display/AST/Getting+a+Backtrace">on the asterisk
wiki</a>.</p>
<p>After recompiling the XiVO version of asterisk with the DEBUG_THREADS
and DONT_OPTIMIZE flags, and with the help of some other people, we
were able to reproduce the freeze and get some information about the
various locks held by the various threads of the frozen asterisk process
via the "coreshow locks" command.</p>
<p>The output of the "core show locks" command looks like this:</p>

<p>and it continues this way for a total of 363 lines.</p>
<p>The big advantage of this representation is that you have a lot of info
to help with precise diagnostics and debugging. But there is a downside
to this:it is quite hard to quickly get the "big picture" of which
thread is waiting for which other thread, etc.</p>
<p>Since it seemed like there were no tools to help us with getting the big
picture, we wrote a really simple python script that takes the output of
the "core show locks" command and outputs a directed graph in <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/content/dot-language">DOT
language</a> of the relations
between the threads. The generated graph is then fed to
<a href="http://www.graphviz.org/Home.php">graphviz</a> to generate an image like
this:</p>
<p><a href="/public/graph-locks.png" title="Asterisk Deadlock"><img alt="Asterisk
Deadlock" src="/public/.graph-locks_m.jpg" title="Asterisk Deadlock, oct. 2012" /></a></p>
<p>Each node represents a thread, labeled with its thread ID, and edges
represent a "is waiting for" relation.</p>
<p>From the above image, we clearly see that there's a deadlock between
thread 0xaeb2db70 and thread 0xb6cffb70 since both are waiting for each
other. We also see a bunch of other threads waiting directly or
indirectly on the deadlocked threads, showing the generalized freeze of
the asterisk process.</p>
<p>The script, which is named graph_ast_locks.py, can be found in <a href="https://gitorious.org/xivo/xivo-tools/trees/master/scripts">the
xivo-tools
repository</a>.
Given you have the output of a "core show locks" invocation, and that
you have graphviz installed, you can then run the following command to
generate a graph in svg format:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>graph_ast_locks.py core-show-locks.txt | circo -Tsvg -o graph-locks.svg
</pre></div>

  <div>
      <p>While implementing the SMBus on the MSP430 (see also the post "<a href="index.php?post/2012/09/29/An-engineering-story">An
engineering story</a>"), I
have been looking for SMBus
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Management_Bus#Packet_Error_Checking" title="PEC"><abbrev title="Packet Error Checking">PEC</abbrev></a>
CRC-8 test vectors but could not find any.</p>
<p>A CRC is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check">Cyclic Redundancy
Check</a>. It is a
little piece of data typically added at the end of a packet and used to
check with an high reliability that no unintended error occurred during
transmission (or storage). The math to do the computation and the check
of a CRC is not very complicated and can be explained to anybody who
knows how to do a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_division">long
division</a>. The polynomial
for the SMBus PEC CRC-8 is x**8+x**2+x**1+1 -- this is a
polynomial in GF(2), but you don't really have to understand that part
to be able to use CRCs in practice. It corresponds to the binary number
100000111, to be used in a particular way. The following text explains
it better than I could:
<a href="http://www.ross.net/crc/download/crc_v3.txt" title="http://www.ross.net/crc/download/crc_v3.txt">http://www.ross.net/crc/download/cr...</a></p>
<p>I made my own SMBus PEC CRC-8 test vectors (attached to this post). The
format is one test vector per line, like:</p>
<p>TV(616263, 5F)</p>
<p>616263 is the 3-byte message in hexadecimal ("abc" in ASCII). The
resulting one byte CRC-8 in hex is 5F.</p>
<p>The test vectors are checked with an official <a href="http://smbus.org/faq/crc8Applet.htm">Java applet from
smbus.org</a>. They include at the
beginning the result for each one byte packet, which is also the table
for the fast byte based implementation: CRC = table[CRC \^ byte]
(because the initial value to use for CRC is zero), On the MSP430, this
implementation should run in something like 9 cycles per byte when
dropped in the right place. (xor CRC, Rm /* 3 cycles */; mov
table[Rm], CRC; /* 6 cycles */)</p>

  <div>
      <p>To be able to track interesting quality metrics of our upcoming XiVO
Office product (XiVO IPBX Open Hardware project), we have decided to add
temperature sensors to our current XIOH pcb.</p>
<p>In computers, the typical way to report the temperature to the main
operating system is through SMBus. This is suitable in our case: we
already have an MSP430 microcontroller that handles the power sequence
and is connected to the SMBus of the board. We will connect some diodes
to the MSP430 to measure the temperature. So the time has come to make
use of the SMBus between the MSP and the EP80579 (our main System On
Chip), for temperature measurements and also other purposes.</p>
<p>The MSP430 does not have a full featured SMBus controller, only a
generic I2C one. SMBus is a variant of I2C, with additional electrical
and timing constraints in the physical layer and definition of the
messages at the network layer level.</p>
<p>Although formatting and parsing SMBus messages is easy, properly using
the I2C controller of the MSP430 in a multi-master environment is not
without pitfalls, even if we did not care about the SMBus timing
constraints. To do it with the needed reliability, it is necessary to
have a detailed knowledge of the whole system and to take into
consideration all kind of interactions on the bus and in the chips. In
our business, the reliability wanted by the customers is typically high
enough that it makes sense to build robust systems instead of rushing a
collapsing sandcastle to market. Plus, in that particular case, we are
dealing with the subsystem that brings and keeps the whole board
running, and for which the cost to debug in the field is absurdly high.</p>
<p>All complex chips come with various design errors, and the MSP430 is no
exception. On the exact version that we use, there are 6 documented
errors affecting the I2C controller, of which 4 clearly apply to our
board, 1 clearly does not apply, and one required careful system
analysis to determine that the preconditions to this erroneous behavior
could not happen in our system.</p>
<p>On top of the 4 errata applying to the I2C controller, we have to deal
with errata for other parts of the MSP430, plus some detailled aspects
that are not errata but are also limiting the way we can make a reliable
use of the chip for the tasks we want.Failure to properly take all those
details into consideration would lead to eventual faults of various
natures, probably including MSP430 crashes impossible to diagnose and
leading to spurious shutdowns, systems stuck in the powered state, or
any random behavior and degradation of system functions.</p>
<p>The impact could be full-scale, with potential consequences on:
availability, maintainability, safety, security, and reliability!</p>
<p>It is worthwhile to note that one of the errata that could have the
biggest consequences can only be handled by using one specific software
architecture to drive the I2C controller, and that specific software
architecture is not the first thing that comes to mind in our
preexisting firmware. This is a case where iteration on the design of
the I2C code would have meant its complete rewrite.</p>
<p>Complex systems, even moderately so, need a careful design, especially
on components that are critical for business or technical reasons.
Wishful thinking never produces high reliability and neither does
excessive reliance on luck. Modeling, even informally, sometimes pays.</p>

      <p>XiVO has been around for over five years now and its use has greatly
evolved since then. From small installations of a few users, XiVO
evolved to support installations of hundreds of users and more recently
major contact centers. We now see XiVO installations with a few
thousands of users, multiple agents, queues and contexts and call
volumes ever increasing. This growth has brought the XiVO dev team new
challenges concerning the architecture of XiVO as not all parts of XiVO
were ready for this kind of sollicitation. We knew it. We knew there
were some bottlenecks we would need to adress.</p>
<p>We are agile and this means, among other things, that we do not build
bridges before we need to cross rivers. Now we're there. We need a
bridge! The XiVO dev team has been working hard in the last months to
overcome some of the major challenges of XiVO.</p>
<p>One of these challenges is linked with the decentralized/multi-component
nature of XiVO. Indeed as you can read in an <a href="/index.php?post/2012/06/11/XiVO-Architecture">older
post</a>, XiVO is a rich
multi-component ecosystem with way too many inter-relations. This has
been a work in progress for a while now were the mission is to reduce
the number of inter-relations as much as possible by better defining
each component's jurisdiction.</p>
<p>We recently had to tackle a very specific challenge where XiVO's use of
Asterisk's AMI could disrupt basic telephony (A calls B). For people who
don't know, AMI stands for Asterisk Manager Interface and is an Asterisk
component allowing custom clients to connect and interact with Asterisk
via a socket. In the XiVO ecosystem, the CTI daemon (CTId) is the major
consumer of Asterisk's AMI. The CTId is a monothreaded python daemon
responsible of handling XiVO client connections. The more users on a
given XiVO installation, the more XiVO clients can potentially connect
to the CTId and thus, the more traffic the CTId exchanges with the AMI.
This traffic can be quite impressive when considering a XiVO
installation under heavy telephony load. The CTId's event loop is a
synchronous blocking loop and while in this loop, the CTId cannot handle
any other jobs. This weakness would not be so terrible if the CTId
wasn't doing anything else than handling XiVO clients connections as it
would only impact those connections and nothing else. This specific
issue is still a major one and we'll adress how we handled it in a later
post.</p>
<p>Now if you remember the <a href="/public/xivosoft/xivo_architecture.png">schema of XiVO's
architecture</a> in our <a href="/index.php?post/2012/06/11/XiVO-Architecture">previously
cited post</a>, you can see
an interconnection between the CTId and the AGI. This relation handled
mainly the reverse directory lookups, used to display a callerID of
incoming call matching a number in a directory. Now this was a major
issue as it meant that any calls passed while the CTId was 'blocked' at
handling AMI traffic would not go through: A cannot call B anymore!</p>
<p>This was not much of an issue when a typical XiVO installation was
populated with a few users as it almost never happened that calls would
be blocked because of reverse directory lookups (or happened not often
enough for users to even notice and signal the issue). With growing XiVO
installations, it became obviously disruptive.</p>
<p>The solution was to remove anything from the CTId that could impact
telephony. From this perspective, any calls to the AGI in the CTId where
moved to nothing else than the AGId, the daemon responsible for handling
communications with Asterisk's AGI. It seems quite obvious when you
think of it and one might ask Why oh why was it not already that way? An
ever evolving XiVO dev team with five years at developping XiVO,
learning a whole lot along the way has to be the only responsible
answer.</p>
<p>XiVO is becoming more mature every day and so is its development team,
producing a software ecosystem always stronger, more mature and more
robust. We love building bridges, bring in the rivers!</p>
