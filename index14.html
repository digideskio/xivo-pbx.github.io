    <p>
      Posted on Mon 21 October 2013 in <a href="http://blog.xivo.io/category/xivo-ipbx.html">XiVO IPBX</a>
    </p>
  </header>
  <div>
      <p>It's been a while since we gave any updates, but we've been quite
active.</p>
<p>We are currently writing a REST API to configure XiVO, giving access to
asimplified set of the Web interface's controls and replacing thecurrent
Web services. A few examples of what can be done with this API
includelisting users, lines, extensions, devices, voicemails, creating
users, givingthem a SIP line and an extension. The documentation of the
API is available
<a href="http://documentation.xivo.fr/dev/api_sdk/rest_api/1.1/api-1.1.html" title="API documentation">online</a>.</p>
<p>The REST API offers one new feature that is not possible via the Web
interface:associating multiple users to a single SIP line. The main use
case is for multipleusers sharing the same physical phone. They can be
called using the same ordifferent extensions.</p>
<p>The next step to improve the rest api would be to associate a device to
a user,which can currently only be done via the web interface.
unfortunately, thisrequires cleaning and rewriting in python a pretty
big bunch of code fromthe php web interface, mainly because of the
handling of programmablefunction keys, so we are taking the time to do
it right.</p>
<p>This development has three consequences:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First, we are cleaning the storage systems for users, lines, devices,
etc., which means changing the database schema and removing useless data
caches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second, we are developing a Python interface to configure XiVO, which
our REST API uses, and which eventually third-party Python scripts will
be able to use, once it is documented.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Third, we're pushing all configuration events into a software bus
(RabbitMQ), so that XiVO components are aware of configuration changes,
and eventually third-party programs may be aware of them as well. Again,
this will be available once it is documented.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We are also going towards upgrading XiVO to the next version of Debian
namedWheezy. The next step is to backport PostgreSQL from Wheezy, so
that thedatabase migration, which is not so simple, is not done at the
same time as thewhole system upgrade.</p>
<p>Finally, we moved all our Git repositories to Github. Some time ago, we
movedsome of our repositories to Gitorious, which we preferred because
it iscompletely based on free software, but we've had a few problems
with it.So we decided to switch to Github. You can now fork us at

      <p>Dear XIOH followers,</p>
<p><strong>As we have passed the CE marking certification, we have finalized the
label that we will have on our product with the revelant informations
necessary to identify the product once on the market :</strong></p>
<p><img alt="XIOH_Label" src="/public/XIOHv5/.P1070110_m.jpg" title="XIOH_Label, mar. 2013" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>"XIOH - version 5"</strong> : the name of the product and the hardware
    version</li>
<li><strong>"S/N : XIOH-5-1236-29"</strong> ; the serial number including the
    hardware version (5), the production batch (1236) and the number in
    this batch (29)</li>
<li><strong>"AC input: 100-240V\~, 4-2A, 60-50Hz"</strong> : indication on the power
    requirements used by our ATX 180W power supply</li>
<li><strong>"Manufacturer :Avencall"</strong> : the name of the manufacturer (that
    could be different is different production project)</li>
<li><strong>"Sources : http://0001-0001.okey.ohanda.org"</strong> : the OHANDA
    trademark is our legal umbrella for this OpenHardware
    project/product and a direct link to the GIT repository of our
    hardware and software files is indicated on the label. This will
    help the customers and users getting information on the hardware,
    contacting us and sharing information</li>
<li><strong>"Made in France"</strong> : we are currently producing in France (i.e.
    locally as we are based here) but we would rather talk about local
    production to track down the carbone footprint of our product from
    components sourcing to cabling and packaging</li>
<li><strong>Differents logos</strong> including the "CE" (1) and RoHS process of
    production as well as the OHANDA logo.</li>

      <p>Dear XIOH followers and developers,</p>
<p><strong>We are now entering our beta-test period with our first batch of XIOH
appliances</strong> available for shipping for developers and power-users that
could be interested in testing and giving feedback on our product. The
appliances are currently shipped in a metallic 1U-rackable case for up
to 50 users and 10 simultaneous calls. It ships with <a href="http://mirror.xivo.fr/iso/" title="XiVO 12.24">XiVO
12.24</a>. We're using free
<a href="http://git.xivo.fr/?p=official/xioh/firmware.git;a=summary">MSP430
firmware</a>
running the power sequence of voltage levels for the different
functional blocks, and a <a href="http://git.xivo.fr/?p=official/xioh/coreboot.git;a=summary">free CPU boot
firmware</a>
based on <a href="http://coreboot.org">Coreboot</a>. Each ROM contains MAC
addresses with our OUI prefix, and a serial number. <a href="http://git.xivo.fr/?p=official/xioh/hardware.git;a=summary">Public design
source
files</a> are
also available.</p>
<p><strong>Here is a glimpse on the look-and-feel of the appliance:</strong></p>

<p>If anyone is interested, please contact us at
xcarcelle_at_avencall_dot_com for availability and potential
shipping.</p>
<p>The feedback of our first appliances running in production in 5
different locations are good and we are able to confirm that we can
handle up to 1000 calls a day on a single XiVO IOH.</p>

    <h2><a href="http://blog.xivo.io/a-switchboard-for-xivo.html#a-switchboard-for-xivo">A Switchboard for XiVO</a></h2>
    <p>
      Posted on Fri 14 December 2012 in <a href="http://blog.xivo.io/category/software.html">Software</a>
    </p>
  </header>
  <div>
      <p>One of the long time missing feature of XiVO is a good switchboard
interface. We havebeen working on a new switchboard profile for the XiVO
client and this post isan overview of what you might expect in the next
few releases.</p>
<p><img alt="switchboard.png" src="/public/.switchboard_m.jpg" title="switchboard.png, déc. 2012" /></p>
<p>As we've said before, we are now releasing a new version every two weeks
andeach release must succeed our test suite before being sent into
production.That means that we will have to ship the new switchboard one
piece at a time. Thefirst three user stories of the switchboard will be
available in the nextrelease (12.24). In fact, one of these story was
already implemented in 12.23but we did not send this release into
production since we are replacingchan_agent with xivo-agent, but that's
another story.</p>
<p>The first user story is to be able to answer an incoming call with a
click ora key press. To accomplish this goal, we created a new xlet
called switchboard,not to be confused with the switchboard profile. The
switchboard xlet issplitted in three sections, incoming calls on the
left, calls on hold on the right andthe current call on the top spanning
from left to right. When a call reachesthe switchboard, it is shown in
the list on the left of the switchboard. Theoperator can then press
enter or click the call to answer it.</p>
<p>The call flow leads us to the next user story, which is to show the
currentcall at the top of the switchboard xlet. The caller id name and
number areavailable and buttons are available for each actions that can
be done on thatcall. Each button also has a key binding to allow fast
call distribution.Actions will be added to this frame until each desired
action is present.At the end of the current sprint, only hangup and hold
will be available.</p>
<p>The third story that we are addressing is the holded call list that is
on theright side of the xlet. These are the calls that have been
answered by theoperator a first time but that have not been distributed
yet (excluding thecurrent call).</p>
<p>All of these new functinnality are planned for version 12.24 that will
bereleased on december 19th.</p>
<p>What are the next steps</p>
<ul>
<li>Call transfers (the contact xlet can already be used to transfer to
    other users)</li>
<li>Call tracking (to know what happenned to previously
    distributed calls)</li>
</ul>
<p>See the documentation for all the details to enable your new XiVO
switchboard.</p>
