    <h2><a href="http://blog.xivo.io/a-switchboard-for-xivo.html#a-switchboard-for-xivo">A Switchboard for XiVO</a></h2>
    <p>
      Posted on Fri 14 December 2012 in <a href="http://blog.xivo.io/category/software.html">Software</a>
    </p>

  <div>
      <p>One of the long time missing feature of XiVO is a good switchboard
interface. We havebeen working on a new switchboard profile for the XiVO
client and this post isan overview of what you might expect in the next
few releases.</p>
<p><img alt="switchboard.png" src="/public/.switchboard_m.jpg" title="switchboard.png, déc. 2012" /></p>
<p>As we've said before, we are now releasing a new version every two weeks
andeach release must succeed our test suite before being sent into
production.That means that we will have to ship the new switchboard one
piece at a time. Thefirst three user stories of the switchboard will be
available in the nextrelease (12.24). In fact, one of these story was
already implemented in 12.23but we did not send this release into
production since we are replacingchan_agent with xivo-agent, but that's
another story.</p>
<p>The first user story is to be able to answer an incoming call with a
click ora key press. To accomplish this goal, we created a new xlet
called switchboard,not to be confused with the switchboard profile. The
switchboard xlet issplitted in three sections, incoming calls on the
left, calls on hold on the right andthe current call on the top spanning
from left to right. When a call reachesthe switchboard, it is shown in
the list on the left of the switchboard. Theoperator can then press
enter or click the call to answer it.</p>
<p>The call flow leads us to the next user story, which is to show the
currentcall at the top of the switchboard xlet. The caller id name and
number areavailable and buttons are available for each actions that can
be done on thatcall. Each button also has a key binding to allow fast
call distribution.Actions will be added to this frame until each desired
action is present.At the end of the current sprint, only hangup and hold
will be available.</p>
<p>The third story that we are addressing is the holded call list that is
on theright side of the xlet. These are the calls that have been
answered by theoperator a first time but that have not been distributed
yet (excluding thecurrent call).</p>
<p>All of these new functinnality are planned for version 12.24 that will
bereleased on december 19th.</p>
<p>What are the next steps</p>
<ul>
<li>Call transfers (the contact xlet can already be used to transfer to
    other users)</li>
<li>Call tracking (to know what happenned to previously
    distributed calls)</li>
</ul>
<p>See the documentation for all the details to enable your new XiVO
switchboard.</p>

      <p>Hello once again XiVO followers ! What's this ? My first blog post has
barely been published and i've already written a second one ! But this
time, i'll be writing about something that will be more interesting for
1337 h@X0r\$ and the like: the Hackfest !</p>
<h3>Hackfest ? What's a Hackfest ?</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.hackfest.ca" title="Hackfest">Hackfest</a> is one of the biggest
events about computer security in the province of Quebec. This year,
more than 400 participants were treated to 2 days full of conferences
and hacking games like Lockpicking, Cyber warfare and Capture The Flag.</p>
<p><img alt="Hackfest
cyberwar" src="/public/HackFest2012/.hackfest_cyberwar_m.jpg" title="Hackfest cyberwar, Nov 2012" /></p>
<p>XiVO also participated in the Hackfest by giving a conference and
organising the XiVO pwn2own hacking game.</p>
<h3>What kind of conference ?</h3>
<p>We gave a conference about the security and future of free
telecommunications, the slides are available in attachment of this post.
The conference was supposed to be given by our colleague <a href="http://twitter.com/nicboul" title="Nicolas Bouliane's twitter feed">Nicolas
Bouliane</a>,
but unfortunately, he got sick a few days before the event. Me and my
SCRUM master gave the talk instead. Here's a picture of us during the
conference. As you can see, the room was pretty full !</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hackfest2k9/8147555929/" title="Hackfest 2012: avencall #hf2012 by hackfest.ca, on Flickr"><img alt="Hackfest 2012: avencall
#hf2012" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8328/8147555929_6aa0caf977.jpg" /></a></p>
<h3>What about the pwn2own ?</h3>
<p>Hackers were given 48 hours to try and hack a standard XiVO server and
find the most exploits possible. As the game went on, clues were given
out through our twitter feed.</p>
<p><img alt="XiVO twitter
feed" src="/public/HackFest2012/.xivo_twitter_feed_m.jpg" title="XiVO twitter feed, Nov 2012" /></p>
<p>Once a hacker found an exploit, he could submit it to our scoreboard to
win points. At the end of the game, the top 3 teams with the most points
won cash prizes. Here's a screenshot of the scoreboard at the end of the
game.</p>
<p><img alt="XiVO
Scoreboard" src="/public/HackFest2012/.xivo_score_board_m.jpg" title="XiVO Scoreboard, Nov 2012" /></p>
<h3>So what happened ? Did you get hacked ?!</h3>
<p>Yes ! As you can see from the scoreboard, 3 teams were able to find
quite a few exploits in XiVO. What surprised us most was the number of
hacks that were found on the web interface. Since XiVO is first and
foremost a telephony system, we thought that the hackers would
concentrate on hacking the telephone services (For example, control SIP
accounts, create fake telephones through the Provisionning service, DDoS
the Asterisk server) After all, the web interface is only used for
administrative purposes and isn't a critical piece of the XiVO server.
Instead, we got a total of 10 web exploits and only 1 telephone exploit.</p>
<h3>What happens now ?</h3>
<p>The XiVO dev team is working on fixing all the exploits found during the
pwn2own. The fixes will be released in version 12.22 at the end of next
week.</p>
<p>All in all, we had great fun participating in the Hackfest. We're
already thinking about how we can make the game more exciting next year,
like how to encourage people to go explore more of XiVO's telephony
services.</p>
<p>Thanks again to the 3 teams who participated in XIVO's pwn2own
(RingZer0, Abed&amp;Francis and Bitducks). We look forward to more hacking
next year !</p>

<p>For a second year, Avencall was present on the biggest Asterisk
conference in the world: Astricon.This year, the conference was held in
Georgia, Atlanta.</p>
<p>Like every year, the Monday is the AstriDevCon, a small conference for
developers by the developers to discuss the future and how to improve
Asterisk. It's a very nice place to get to know the other people that
are coding inside Asterisk and also to coordinate with others about what
has to be done.</p>
<p>You can find a nice resume of the whole day of discussion here:
<a href="https://wiki.asterisk.org/wiki/display/AST/AstriDevCon+2012">https://wiki.asterisk.org/wiki/display/AST/AstriDevCon+2012</a></p>
<p>As you can see, this year we also had a booth (#28). It was a great
experience to expose ourself at Astricon because there is a huge flow of
people interested and interesting. It was a lot of fun to talk about the
XiVO project and the XiVO Open Hardware. All the gizmos we had on our
table really attracted may people, especially the raspberry pi that was
running XiVO.</p>

<p>To communicate further about us, we also gave a conference to present
Avencall and the XiVO telephony system.</p>

    <h2><a href="http://blog.xivo.io/a-conference-with-uncle-bob.html#a-conference-with-uncle-bob">A conference with Uncle Bob</a></h2>
    <p>
      Posted on Mon 05 November 2012 in <a href="http://blog.xivo.io/category/articles.html">articles</a>
    </p>
  </header>
  <div>
      <p>Hello to everyone following the XiVO blog ! My name is Gregory Eric
Sanderson Turcot Temlett MacDonnell Forbes. I've been working on the
XiVO software team for 2 months now and the time has come to publish my
first official blog post. Enjoy ;)</p>
<p>At the end of last september, the XiVO team had the amazing chance of
attending a talk given by none other than Robert C. Martin himself ! Mr.
Martin, also known as "Uncle Bob", is a highly experienced software
developer with over 30 years of experience. The subject of his talk was
seemingly simple: What should we expect from a professional software
developer ? More that you would think. Uncle bob divided his talk into
about a dozen different expectations. Here is my personal interpretation
for each expectation he gave.</p>
<h2>You will not ship shit</h2>
<p>Pretty provocative for a first expectation, eh ?</p>
<p>Why is this even on the list ? If programmers are professionals, then
they should already be shipping quality code, right ? The reality is
that programmers have to deal with issues that can easily lower the
quality of their software:Tight deadlines, small budget, crappy code,
infuriating clients, overly complex architectures, etc. Bad habits are
hard to break, so when you start shipping shit, it becomes easier to do
so again and again.</p>
<p>But here's a thought: Software is being found increasingly more often in
critical systems, like pacemakers for example. What happens if a
programmer ships faulty software directly into a person's heart ? When
the software that wedevelop can tip the balance between life and death,
then as professionals, we should never need to "ship shit". At the very
least, we should always aim to never do so.</p>
<h2>You will ship all the time</h2>
<p>Stories about unkempt deadlines or missed release dates are all over the
internet. Worse yet, sometimes software is delivered on time, but
upgrades become catastrophic.</p>
<p>Let's face it, there will always be situations where a client who would
like additional feature X to be ready within 2 weeks, but in the end it
takes 2 months to develop. So what can you do to make the situation
better ? Well, by making sure you're always being ready to ship at a
moment's notice. Shipping all the time might seem impossible the first
time you consider it, but it forces you to develop certain habits that
make your software more stable. Namely,</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Easier deployments</strong>. Your deployment strategy needs to be simple,
    fast, and automated. Once that's in place, you no longer need to
    plan your upgrades since you can re-use your automated procedure</li>
<li><strong>Client satisfaction</strong>. The client no longer needs to wait to get
    the latest version of your software</li>
<li><strong>Less time wasted</strong>. Less time spent on shipping and upgrades means
    more time to work on more important stuff</li>
</ul>
<p>How do you ship all the time ? One way is through Continuous
Integration, but it isn't the only approach. What's important is to find
a way that works well with your software and your team.</p>
<h2>Inexpensive Adaptability</h2>
<p>The concept of evolution is key here. Code that doesn't evolve is prone
to stagnation and becomes harder to adapt, leading to technical debt.
How do you make sure your code doesn't stagnate ? As Uncle Bob would
say: "you need to flex your code" You can test the adaptability of your
software by looking at how complex it would be to suddenly change a
major component of the system. For example: try changing the database,
use another protocol, redesign the UI. The less changes that are needed,
the more adaptive your code becomes. One example of potential
adaptability that you might consider is the SQL vs NoSQL debate. If you
suddenly needed to change from one to the other, how much effort and how
much code would you need to change ? The less there is, the better.</p>
<h2>Extreme Quality</h2>
<p>As professionals, we should always aim to produce the best work that we
can. Here's my personal list of what I consider to be quality work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clean code</li>
<li>Code that is easy to modify</li>
<li>Clear and concise documentation</li>
<li>Simple architecture designs</li>
<li>Tests that cover all known use cases</li>
<li>Reasonnable and honest estimates</li>
<li>Calm Attitude</li>
</ul>
<p>Quality also means dealing with our mistakes. Some mistakes can be
simple to fix, others might be impossible to re-mediate. What's most
important, is that we always ask ourselves "What can I do so that I
don't repeat the same mistake next time ? "At the end of the day, we
should be proud of our job and the work we have done, knowing that we
have accomplished the best that was possible.</p>
<h2>QA will find nothing</h2>
<p>Programmers are responsible for the quality of the code they develop.
Therefore, they should also be responsible for making sure that there
are no bugs in what they give to QA. Using QA as a fallback for writing
more code without checking for bugs is a bad habit to take. Small bugs
from time to time is an acceptable limit, but if QA comes back with a
list of bugs every time, then it's probably a sign that the programmer
isn't taking the quality of his code seriously. As Uncle Bob said during
the conference, "QA should find nothing. They should even ask themselves
why they exist"</p>
<h2>We cover for each other</h2>
<p>Teamwork isn't just about cooperation with other teammates, it's also
about sharing knowledge. When you have people in a team that specialize
in a certain domain, you risk losing all the experience that he's
acquired if ever he suddenly disappears. To make sure a team can
continue going forwards, even in unexpected situations, there should
always be more that one person who has the know how for any and every
Class or module in your code. How do you go about sharing that
experience ? One way is through pair programming, but it certainly isn't
the only way. Try finding what works best with all the members of your
team.</p>
<h2>Honest estimates</h2>
<p>Programmers estimate their tasks everyday, but how many of those
estimates are "honest" ? Honest estimates means giving a straight answer
instead of changing numbers to fit time constraints or a budget. It
means giving a time range (for example: 1 to 3 weeks) instead of a time
limit that will probably be busted. It also means readjusting an
estimate the moment you realize the first one won't work anymore.
Keeping estimates honest shows that you are commited to your work. It
also gives decision makers a better picture of the complexity of the
work at hand.</p>
<h2>Automation</h2>
<p>One of the things Uncle Bob said that really struck me was "As people
whose job is to automate things, I can't believe how much time
programmers spend repeating the same mundane tasks". I have to admit, he
has a point. The time we spend writing code compared to the time we take
to test it can boggle the mind. That time that could be well spent
working on other tasks equally as important, like improving code
structure for example. Although tests can be automated through
techniques like TDD or BDD, the principle of automation can also apply
to any recurrent task that's part of your daily development tasks.</p>
<p>Let me give you an example from my team leader: At the beginning of
every sprint, he needs to generate a series of charts showing various
statistics about the project. Before, he would manually copy numbers in
a spreadsheet and generate the chart every week. Now that he's automated
the chart generation, he can spend more time with his team.</p>
<h2>Continuous aggressive learning</h2>
<p>"As programmers, we must learn to learn." Here are a few things that a
programmer needs to keep up with in order to do his job: hardware,
software, programming languages, operating systems, libraries,
frameworks. The speed at which these things can evolve is so quick that
it becomes ever more important to take the time to learn about changes
and keep up to date. Uncle Bob even suggested that the time you take to
learn these things should be separate from the time spent at work since
this represents a personal investment that enables you to stay
professional. Continuous learning is a key skill in our ever-evolving
profession. Those who fail to adapt risk falling behind.</p>
<h2>Mentoring</h2>
<p>Another approach to continuous learning is to teach. Mentoring is a way
of checking if you have a mastery of your knowledge since you need to be
proficient with your subject to teach successfully. It is also a way of
guiding other people on the path to professional software development.
Finally, mentoring can also be seen as a form of team work: there will
be more people who share the same knowledge (see "We cover for each
other" above)</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I really enjoyed listening to Robert C. Martin's conference. I still
consider myself as a young programmer, and this talk has convinced me of
the importance of taking some personal time to investigate what I
personally need to change in order to, one day, proudly proclaim myself
as a "professional programmer". What I also appreciated from the talk
was Uncle Bob's focus on goals instead of techniques. In other words, no
matter what methodology or technology you prefer using (TDD, BDD, Agile,
Waterfall, C++, python, .net, java, or whatever else) we should never
lose sight of what we should be doing to stay proud about the best job
out there: programming.</p>
<p>That's it for my first blog post folks ! I hope you enjoyed it and look
forward to my next one. If you'd like to discuss more about what i've
written, you're more than welcome to leave comments.</p>

  <div>
      <p>XiVO can be managed using a web interface. This interface is developed
in PHP language using a XiVO specific framework.</p>
<p>The idea of this post is to begin to demystify XiVO web interface
development.</p>
<h4>Setting The Development Environment</h4>
<p>First of all, we are going to set up of development environment. The
best is to enable nfs mount on your development workstation and to mount
the web interface development directory onto your XiVO virtual
machine.If your development projects is located in /projects/xivo-skaro,
the mount command can be :</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>mount -t nfs devipaddress:/projects/xivo-skaro/web-interface/src /usr/share/pf-xivo-web-interface
</pre></div>


<p>Now each time you will modify a file within the web-interface directory,
you can check your update by refreshing your browser.</p>
<h4>XiVO Hello World Page</h4>
<p>So let's start by writing a simple web page to display "Hello XiVO
world", doesn't remind you something ?</p>
<h4>XiVO Actions, Applications and Objects.</h4>
<p><img alt="webi_src.png" src="/public/xivosoft/webi_src.png" title="webi_src.png, oct. 2012" />XiVO
web interface is mainly composed of three types of elements :</p>
<ul>
<li>actions, this is kind of controller, and will route the action to be
    done (list, create, edit) to the proper application</li>
<li>applications, to be considered as the business layer, contains the
    algorithm to be applied</li>
<li>objects, mainly where the persistence takes place.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many other components, but let's start first be this simple
view.</p>
<p>So if we need to display something, we have to follow these necessary
steps :</p>
<ul>
<li>Write a simple PHP page as an action</li>
<li>Add this action in the authorized control list</li>
<li>Add it to the proper menu</li>
<li>Link the menu generated URL to the proper URL</li>
<li>Add necessary translations to XiVO translation files</li>
</ul>
<h3>Writing The Page</h3>
<p>Let's start with a simple page that we want to be displayed in the menu
"services -&gt; IPBX -&gt; Call management", edit a file
xivo-skaro/web-interface/src/action/www/service/ipbx/asterisk/call_management/hellowivo.php</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>
    <span class="k">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Hello XiVO world !&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="cp">?&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<h3>XiVO Authorization Framework</h3>
<p>You cannot still browse this new page because this page is not declared
within XiVO authorization framework. The list of available pages is
located in the file
xivo-skaro/web-interface/src/object/objectconf/acl/user.inc.Edit this
file and add this new action.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="x">....</span>
<span class="p">$</span><span class="nv">array</span><span class="x">[&#39;tree&#39;][&#39;service&#39;][&#39;ipbx&#39;][&#39;call_management&#39;][&#39;pickup&#39;] = true;</span>
<span class="p">$</span><span class="nv">array</span><span class="x">[&#39;tree&#39;][&#39;service&#39;][&#39;ipbx&#39;][&#39;call_management&#39;][&#39;schedule&#39;] = true;</span>
<span class="p">$</span><span class="nv">array</span><span class="x">[&#39;tree&#39;][&#39;service&#39;][&#39;ipbx&#39;][&#39;call_management&#39;][&#39;cel&#39;] = true;</span>
<span class="p">$</span><span class="nv">array</span><span class="x">[&#39;tree&#39;][&#39;service&#39;][&#39;ipbx&#39;][&#39;call_management&#39;][&#39;helloxivo&#39;] = true;</span>
<span class="x">.....</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Now you can browse the page https://&lt;your xivo
host&gt;/service/ipbx/index.php/call_management/helloxivo.</p>
<p>Create a XiVO user (menu Configuration-&gt; Management -&gt; Users) and
check the authorizations for this user (click on the small key icon next
to the user) and you will see that a new item appears under call
management.<img alt="webi_acl.png" src="/public/xivosoft/.webi_acl_m.jpg" title="webi_acl.png, oct. 2012" /></p>
<h3>Translation</h3>
<p>You can also note that an error message 'missing translation' is
displayed. This is a special marker to be sure that nobody forget to
write the translation strings. These translations are located in
directory src/i18n were a directory per language can be find.</p>
<p>Edit the file en_US/conf/acl.i18n and add the translation
service-ipbx-call_management-helloxivo and to not forget to add the
french translation, as in XiVO we always complete the french and english
translation.</p>
<p>Now we can display the new page, and can authorize a user to use this
new page, still to do is to be able to use this new page using XiVO
menu.</p>
<h3>XiVO Menu Entries</h3>
<p>Edit
xivo-skaro/web-interface/src/tpl/www/bloc/menu/left/service/ipbx/asterisk.php,
add the menu entry :</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>........
        if(xivo_user::chk_acl(&#39;call_management&#39;,&#39;cel&#39;) === true):
            echo    &#39;<span class="nt">&lt;dd</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">&quot;mn-call_management--cel&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>&#39;,
                $url-&gt;href_html($this-&gt;bbf(&#39;mn_left_callmanagement-cel&#39;),
                        &#39;service/ipbx/call_management/cel&#39;),
                &#39;<span class="nt">&lt;/dd&gt;</span>&#39;;
        endif;
        if(xivo_user::chk_acl(&#39;call_management&#39;,&#39;helloxivo&#39;) === true):
            echo    &#39;<span class="nt">&lt;dd</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">&quot;mn-call_management--helloxivo&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>&#39;,
                $url-&gt;href_html($this-&gt;bbf(&#39;mn_left_callmanagement-helloxivo&#39;),
                        &#39;service/ipbx/call_management/helloxivo&#39;),
                &#39;<span class="nt">&lt;/dd&gt;</span>&#39;;
        endif;
        echo    &#39;<span class="nt">&lt;/dl&gt;</span>&#39;;
    endif;

........
</pre></div>


<p>Fix the translation by adding in
xivo-skaro/web-interface/src/i18n/en_US/tpl/www/bloc/menu/left/service/ipbx/asterisk.i18n
the translation to mn_left_callmanagement-helloxivo</p>
<p>The menu is now correctly displayed, but you still cannot click on it to
display your new page. We must now register the menu URL within the XiVO
framework.</p>
<h3>XiVO URL Routing</h3>
<p>Edit xivo-skaro/web-interface/src/object/objectconf/url.inc and add the
URL translation</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="x">.......</span>
<span class="p">$</span><span class="nv">array</span><span class="x">[&#39;service/ipbx/call_management/schedule&#39;] = &#39;service/ipbx/index.php/call_management/schedule/&#39;;</span>
<span class="p">$</span><span class="nv">array</span><span class="x">[&#39;service/ipbx/call_management/voicemenu&#39;] = &#39;service/ipbx/index.php/call_management/voicemenu/&#39;;</span>
<span class="p">$</span><span class="nv">array</span><span class="x">[&#39;service/ipbx/call_management/cel&#39;] = &#39;service/ipbx/index.php/call_management/cel/&#39;;</span>
<span class="p">$</span><span class="nv">array</span><span class="x">[&#39;service/ipbx/call_management/helloxivo&#39;] = &#39;service/ipbx/index.php/call_management/helloxivo/&#39;;</span>

<span class="x">.......</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Now you may click on the new menu entry and display the Hello XiVO world
page</p>
<p><img alt="webi_hello_menu.png" src="/public/xivosoft/webi_hello_menu.png" title="webi_hello_menu.png, oct. 2012" />As
you may notice this page is not displayed using XiVO look and feel, but
that's another story.</p>
