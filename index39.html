<p><strong>I just got back from the Pixelache Festival in Helsinki</strong> (1) where we
had a OHANDA (2) meeting with the founding members of the OHANDA
initiative (Juergen Neumann from Freifunk in Berlin and Tuomo Tammenpää
from Yatta in Helskinki) in order to discuss the next steps for the
usage of the <strong>OHANDA licence/trademark</strong> with OpenHardware projects.</p>
<p>The OHANDA licence/trademark is definitely the most advanced initiative
so far after the work we had done on the OpenHardwareInitiative and
presented at the OpenTechSummit 2008 (3) in Taiwan with different
hardware projects (OpenMoko, OpenPattern, ...) looking for an umbrella
for their licence adapting the GPL licences used for FOSS projects.</p>
<p>A first presentation of the OHANDA licence/trademark had been done at
GOSH and PIKSEL (4) with the organization of the trademark and the
relations between hardware designer and users/clients as described below
:</p>
<p><img alt="OHANDA Step

<p>This is a great opportunity for the <strong>XiVO IPBX OpenHardware project to
apply this up-coming licence/trademark</strong> to the future product (product
registered with a <strong>unique OHANDA #ID</strong>) and garantee a common
umbrellas for multiple OpenHardware projects.</p>
<p>We will documente the next steps in the OHANDA licence/trademark
setting-up for the XiVO IPBX OpenHardware project in order to make
available the different files of the project and the registration #ID
to follow the updates from the OHANDA trademark.</p>

<p>It was a great pleasure to present the XiVO IPBX OpenHardware project at
SolutionsLinux2010 (the largest Linux fair in France yearly) on last
week and we had several discussions about the architecture choosen for
the IPBX and the interfaces / functionnalities.</p>
<p>We had some great feedbacks from different VoIP projects and deployment
feedbacks that will help us understand the needs from the market.</p>
<p>The next steps are now for the OpenHardware community, to present our
prototyping feddbacks and the detailed architecture that we are
targeting.</p>
<p>Finally, we will presenting soon the work done on the potential
OpenHardware licence that we want to use based on a mixed between
trademarks and CreativeCommons licences.</p>

    <p>
      Posted on Thu 25 February 2010 in <a href="http://blog.xivo.io/category/hardware.html">Hardware</a>
    </p>
  </header>
  <div>
      <p>Following the previous posts about the "open" bootloaders available to
improve and implement advanced features at the boot of your SoC/CPU, we
are, in this post, considering Barebox (formely known as u-boot v2) as
another open bootloader. Barebox aims at giving the developer and
embedded users the best of u-boot (space, easy-to-flash, handy tools)
and the best of the Linux kernel (Kconfig, Kbuild, standards C API,
building methods identical to the kernel with ARCH/CROSS primitives...).</p>
<p>The latest documentation for barebox can be found here <a href="2" title="2">2</a> and
lists the different key features of barebox that can listed as followed:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A posix based file API</strong>: inside barebox the usual
    open/close/read/write/lseek functions are used. This makes it
    familiar to everyone who has programmed under unix systems.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->

<ul>
<li><strong>Usual shell commands</strong> like ls/cd/mkdir/echo/cat,...</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->

<ul>
<li><strong>The environment is a file store</strong>. It has currently some
    limitations, of course. The environment is not a real read/write
    filesystem, it is more like a tar archive, or even more like an ar
    archive, because it cannot handle directories. The saveenv command
    saves the files under a certain directory (by default /env) in
    persistent storage (by default /dev/env0). There is a counterpart
    called loadenv, too.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->

<ul>
<li><strong>Real filesystem support</strong>: The loader starts up with mounting a
    ramdisk on /. Then a devfs is mounted on /dev allowing the user (or
    shell commands) to access devices. Apart from these two filesystems
    there is currently one filesystem ported: cramfs. One can mount it
    with the usual mount command.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->

<ul>
<li><strong>Device/driver model</strong>: Devices are no longer described by defines
    in the config file. Instead there are devices which can be
    registered in the board .c file or dynamically allocated. Drivers
    will match upon the devices automatically.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->

<ul>
<li><strong>Clocksource support</strong>: Timekeeping has been simplified by the use
    of the Linux clocksource API. Only one function is needed for a new
    board, no <a href="gs" title="gs">gs</a>et_timer<a href="masked" title="masked">masked</a>() or
    reset_timer<a href="masked" title="masked">masked</a>() functions.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->

<ul>
<li><strong>Kconfig and Kernel build system</strong>: Only targets which are really
    needed get recompiled. Parallel builds are no problem anymore. This
    also removes the need for many many ifdefs in the code.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->

<ul>
<li><strong>Simulation target</strong>: barebox can be compiled to run under Linux.
    While this is rather useless in real world this is a great debugging
    and development aid. New features can be easily developped and
    tested on long train journeys and started under gdb. There is a
    console driver for linux which emulates a serial device and a tap
    based ethernet driver. Linux files can be mapped to devices under
    barebox to emulate storage devices.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->

<ul>
<li><strong>Device parameter support</strong>: Each device can have a unlimited
    number of parameters. They can be accessed on the command line with
    &lt;devid&gt;.&lt;param&gt;="...", for example 'eth0.ip=192.168.0.7'
    or 'echo \$eth0.ip'</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->

<ul>
<li><strong>Initcalls</strong>: Hooks in the startup process can be archieved
    with *_initcall() directives in each file.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->

<ul>
<li><strong>Getopt</strong>: There is a small getopt implementation. Some commands
    got really complicated (both in code and in usage) due to the fact
    that U-Boot only allowed positional parameters.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->

<ul>
<li>Editor: Scripts can be edited with a small editor.</li>
</ul>
<p>Barebox is under GPLv2 licence.</p>

    <p>
      Posted on Tue 23 February 2010 in <a href="http://blog.xivo.io/category/hardware.html">Hardware</a>

      <p>This series of posts are dedicated to the different opensource
bootloaders available out-there that are or can be used for OpenHardware
project such as the XiVO IPBX we are currently developping.</p>
<p>This second post on the bootloaders available will present U-boot, one
the widely used bootloader for embedded systems. <strong>U-boot stands for
''Das Unterseeboot"</strong> meaning "the submarine" in German and it's also
known as "Das U-Boot -- the Universal Boot Loader".</p>
<p>U-boot is currently supporting a vast range of architectures such as:
including PPC, ARM, AVR32, MIPS, x86, 68k, Nios, and MicroBlaze
(soft-core for Xilinx FPGAs).</p>
<p>The main advantages of the different OpenSource bootloader solutions are
that they allow "userspace" features at the boot such as: interactive
commands (CLI type usually), environment variables(IP, PATH, R/W
permissions...), command scripting(typically shell scripts - namely used
in uboot-v2 a.k.a. barebox and that we will cover in the next post) and
booting from external media (or network fot TFTP rootfs and images
updates for example).</p>
<p>Einfochips <a href="1" title="1">1</a> provides a great documentation guide on how to
port uboot to a new architecture / platform with a stress on the
different files provided by u-boot and the cross-compilation issue for
the targetted platform/board/cpu.</p>
<p>Usually u-boot is stored (i.e. resides in the beginning memory area of
the flash - internal to the CPU or external-flash) in the beginning area
of the flash. This memory address (sector or block) is defined by by the
board for the very early stage of the boot (in board/xxx/init.S). The
start-up code of the processor is then defined (in cpu/arch/start.S -
like in cpu/bf533/start.S for the Blackfin processor). The boot sequence
symbols are usually noticeable as they are prefixed like "_start".</p>
<p>First stage loader: U-boot initializes the CPU and the different
peripherals on the board to allows to jump the the memory (DRAM)
subsystems. The processor core is designed to fetch instructions
starting from _START_ADDRESS_ . The core then attempts to execute the
instructions found here. Because this is the top of the memory range,
the instruction found here must be an unconditional branch instruction.
This core has to be hard-coded to configure the upper memory region so
that it is accessible without programming the external bus controller,
to which Flash memory is usually attached. This forces the requirement
to branch to a location within this address space because the processor
is incapable of addressing memory anywhere else until our bootloader
code initializes additional memory regions.</p>
<p>Second stage loader: U-boot loads itself in the RAM (SDRAM, NVRAM in the
CPU RAM or external RAM) and receives the command to boot the kernel
image. The kernel image is then uncompressed, u-boot loads it to the
memory and gives control to the kernel. The kernel will continue the
execution without u-boot.</p>
<p>This post is just a first description of U-boot and we will get more
details for specific architectures with x86 platform that we are
targetting for the XiVO IPBX project.</p>
