      <p>We had the pleasure to visit the CologneChip AG engineering team this
week in Koln, Germany and exchange on the ISDN markets and chips (and
the different market penetration of ISDN, FTTH, DOCSIS, xDSL in Europe
countries). ISDN is still strong in Germany w/ 29 Millions subscribers
(22M analog subscribers and 6M subscribers w/ DOSCIS and xDSL - sources:
Bundesnetzagentur) and still allow over the 144Kbits/s of net data rate,
2 bearer channels (B-channels) w/ 64Kbits/s each which is equivalent to
3.4Khz voice channel at 8 ksamples/second. The XiVO IPBX OpenHardware
will propose 4 BRI (also called S0 for point-to-multipoint BRI type)
interfaces to allow these data and voice applications.</p>

    <p>
      Posted on Mon 04 October 2010 in <a href="http://blog.xivo.io/category/hardware.html">Hardware</a>

  <div>
      <p>It was a great pleasure to participate to the <strong>OpenHardwareSummit2010
in the New York City Museum of Science</strong> and representing the OHANDA
trademark during the LAW panel. Thanks to Alicia and Ayah to have
organized such an event that gives publicity to the OpenHardware
movement out-there. I have surely pushed the usage of the world
<strong>OpenHardware</strong> (versus the OpenSource-Hardware term that seems to
close to OpenSource software) for the future as the common term for the
hardware projects opening their production and design files. The
audience was 200 people and mainly north-american and that was a great
pleasure to speak and recall the great previous OpenHardware projects
launched in Europe since years now (OpenMoko, OpenPCD, Milkymist,
OpenPattern...).</p>
<p>The summit was a one-day long session of presentations and panel
discussions followed by an exchange about the OpenHardware definition.
During the LAW panel discussion, I had the opportunity to present the
OHANDA trademark and</p>
<p>Some discussions panels attracted my attention :</p>
<p><strong>* PRODUCTIZING: Scaling/ Manufacturing/ Moving beyond DIY :</strong></p>
<p><img alt="OHS2010 - Production
panel" src="/public/.P1040509_m.jpg" title="OHS2010 - Production panel, oct. 2010" />  </p>
<p>This talk was a great opportunity to have the feedbacks of a production
facilities (Clint Cooley from Circuit Co) that supports OpenHardware
projects in the US and see a great ramp-up of the projects requesting
small, medium and large fab of the their PCBs. We can see that some
manufacturers will play a great role in this field and some OpenHardware
project will be able to mutualize some aspects of the production for
bigger PCBs (more layers, 200-500-1000 components-BOM...).</p>
<p><strong>* BUSINESS: Open hardware business models :</strong></p>
<p><img alt="OHS2010 - Marketing
panel" src="/public/.P1040507_m.jpg" title="OHS2010 - Marketing panel, oct. 2010" />  </p>
<p>This talk gives the occasion to hear several business model of
OpenHardware companies ("yes" there is a business model for OpenHardware
projects up to several 100k units per product a year) w/ the
participation of prototyping and products companies such as Chumby
(represented by Bunny skype-ing from Singapore). Definitely the opening
of the design and production files is giving business opportunities for
partners (resellers, hardware-mods, software-hacks, global solutions)
rather than opening the pandora box of copies for cheaper was the global
conclusion of this panel discussion.</p>
<p><strong>* LAW: Open hardware licenses and norms :</strong></p>
<p><img alt="OHS LawPanel
1" src="/public/.OHS_LawPanel_1_m.jpg" title="OHS LawPanel 1, oct. 2010" />  </p>
<p>This panel discussion was the occasion to have around the table several
legal opinions (with lawyers, Peter Brown from the FSF, a hardware
hacker) leading to the following topics :</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>* What is the interest of opening hardware ?
* How to protect a licence/trademark-ed OpenHardware project in case of legal violation from a files point of view ?
* What about the closed documentation of the chips used in an OpenHardware ?
* What about the firmware used in SoC -based OpenHardware projects ?
</pre></div>


<p>Perter Brown from FSF was applausing the 4 freedoms of the OHANDA
trademark adapting the ones from the FSF licence.</p>
<p>Below I have collected some documentations and informations about the
OHS2010 :</p>

      <p>The schematic represents a logical point of view of an electronic
circuit. Before we can design a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printed_circuit_board" title="Printed circuit board">PCB</a>
layout matching this circuit, we must specify how each schematic
component will be physically implemented. For example, a 20 pin chip can
come in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrink_Small-Outline_Package" title="Shrink small-outline package">SSOP</a>
or
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_in-line_package" title="Dual in-line package">DIP</a>,
and the board won't look exactly the same in each case (the traces won't
end at the same places).</p>
<p><img alt="DIL20 to 50 mils spaced
traces" src="/public/dil20.png" title="DIL20 to 50 mils spaced traces, sept. 2010" />
<img alt="SSOP20 to 50 mils spaced
traces" src="/public/ssop20.png" title="SSOP20 to 50 mils spaced traces, sept. 2010" /></p>
<p>The two images above represent 20 traces (50 mils spaced) ending on a
DIL20 package (left) and on a SSOP20 package (right).</p>
<p><img alt="CVpcb icon" src="/public/cvpcb.png" title="CVpcb icon, août 2010" /> In
<a href="http://www.kicad-eda.org/">KiCad</a>, this assignment between schematic
components and module footprint is done with the program named CVpcb.</p>
<p>Before CVpcb can be used, a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netlist">netlist</a> must be generated. A
netlist is an abstract representation of the electronic circuit, which
focus on describing which pins of the various components are
interconnected (in a set that is called a net), disregarding the details
of how they are connected in the schematic drawing. The schematic
drawing is an abstract representation, and for example the length and
the shape of a connection it includes is irrelevant to how this
connection will eventually be physically implemented on the PCB. So the
netlist is simply the list of all the components plus a list of nets,
each one containing a list of interconnected pins of various components.</p>
<p>The netlist and which footprint to use for each component will later be
the input of the PCB design done with PCBnew. To automatically generate
the netlist with EESchema, click on the generate netlist button
<img alt="Generate netlist
button" src="/public/generate_netlist_button.png" title="Generate netlist button, sept. 2010" />
in the top toolbar: a "Netlist" window appears, in which you just have
to click on the button "Netlist" in the tab Pcbnew while the "Default
format" option is selected. You are then presented with a "Save Netlist
Files" dialog, in which you just have to confirm the filename -- it
should already be correctly selected as &lt;project_name&gt;.net in the
project directory.</p>
<p>Now that the netlist is generated, we can use CVpcb. Launch it for
example by clicking on its icon <img alt="Run CVpcb
button" src="/public/run_cvpcb_button.png" title="Run CVpcb button, sept. 2010" />
also in the top toolbar of EESchema.When no affectation has been done
before for the current project, CVpcb immediatly warns that a
&lt;project_name&gt;.cmp file does not exist -- this is not a problem,
it will be created by CVpcb when you save.</p>
<p>Now for each schematic component you can assign a PCB footprint. Select
the component on the left then double click on the footprint you want to
use for it on the right. You can press the first letter of what you are
looking for when one of the two lists is activated.</p>
<p>When you save in CVpcb, it shows a "Save Net and Component List" dialog
defaulting to the same &lt;project_name&gt;.net file that we created
during netlist generation. This is OK, just overwrite the former: CVpcb
will maintain the same netlist in the saved file, but the file will now
also include schematic components to module footprints affectations. A
&lt;project_name&gt;.cmp file is also created behind the scene, which
contains just the affectations using a different file format.</p>
<p>For our clock buffer, the affectation in CVpcb looks like the following
screen-shoot.</p>
<p><img alt="Clock buffer CVpcb footprint assignment
screenshoot" src="/public/cvpcb_sshoot.png" title="Clock buffer CVpcb footprint assignment screenshoot, sept. 2010" /></p>
<p>The corresponding .net and .cmp files are attached to this post.</p>
