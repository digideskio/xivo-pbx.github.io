    <p>
      Posted on Mon 17 September 2012 in <a href="http://blog.xivo.io/category/software.html">Software</a>
    </p>

  <div>
      <p>XiVO has been around for over five years now and its use has greatly
evolved since then. From small installations of a few users, XiVO
evolved to support installations of hundreds of users and more recently
major contact centers. We now see XiVO installations with a few
thousands of users, multiple agents, queues and contexts and call
volumes ever increasing. This growth has brought the XiVO dev team new
challenges concerning the architecture of XiVO as not all parts of XiVO
were ready for this kind of sollicitation. We knew it. We knew there
were some bottlenecks we would need to adress.</p>
<p>We are agile and this means, among other things, that we do not build
bridges before we need to cross rivers. Now we're there. We need a
bridge! The XiVO dev team has been working hard in the last months to
overcome some of the major challenges of XiVO.</p>
<p>One of these challenges is linked with the decentralized/multi-component
nature of XiVO. Indeed as you can read in an <a href="/index.php?post/2012/06/11/XiVO-Architecture">older
post</a>, XiVO is a rich
multi-component ecosystem with way too many inter-relations. This has
been a work in progress for a while now were the mission is to reduce
the number of inter-relations as much as possible by better defining
each component's jurisdiction.</p>
<p>We recently had to tackle a very specific challenge where XiVO's use of
Asterisk's AMI could disrupt basic telephony (A calls B). For people who
don't know, AMI stands for Asterisk Manager Interface and is an Asterisk
component allowing custom clients to connect and interact with Asterisk
via a socket. In the XiVO ecosystem, the CTI daemon (CTId) is the major
consumer of Asterisk's AMI. The CTId is a monothreaded python daemon
responsible of handling XiVO client connections. The more users on a
given XiVO installation, the more XiVO clients can potentially connect
to the CTId and thus, the more traffic the CTId exchanges with the AMI.
This traffic can be quite impressive when considering a XiVO
installation under heavy telephony load. The CTId's event loop is a
synchronous blocking loop and while in this loop, the CTId cannot handle
any other jobs. This weakness would not be so terrible if the CTId
wasn't doing anything else than handling XiVO clients connections as it
would only impact those connections and nothing else. This specific
issue is still a major one and we'll adress how we handled it in a later
post.</p>
<p>Now if you remember the <a href="/public/xivosoft/xivo_architecture.png">schema of XiVO's
architecture</a> in our <a href="/index.php?post/2012/06/11/XiVO-Architecture">previously
cited post</a>, you can see
an interconnection between the CTId and the AGI. This relation handled
mainly the reverse directory lookups, used to display a callerID of
incoming call matching a number in a directory. Now this was a major
issue as it meant that any calls passed while the CTId was 'blocked' at
handling AMI traffic would not go through: A cannot call B anymore!</p>
<p>This was not much of an issue when a typical XiVO installation was
populated with a few users as it almost never happened that calls would
be blocked because of reverse directory lookups (or happened not often
enough for users to even notice and signal the issue). With growing XiVO
installations, it became obviously disruptive.</p>
<p>The solution was to remove anything from the CTId that could impact
telephony. From this perspective, any calls to the AGI in the CTId where
moved to nothing else than the AGId, the daemon responsible for handling
communications with Asterisk's AGI. It seems quite obvious when you
think of it and one might ask Why oh why was it not already that way? An
ever evolving XiVO dev team with five years at developping XiVO,
learning a whole lot along the way has to be the only responsible
answer.</p>
<p>XiVO is becoming more mature every day and so is its development team,
producing a software ecosystem always stronger, more mature and more
robust. We love building bridges, bring in the rivers!</p>

      <h2>Feedback of the factory</h2>
<p>In order to load the factory's pick-and-place machines (2 distinct ones
were used to assemble bottom, then top, then throug-hole components), we
needed an efficient way of sorting the components. Therefore, we created
a database of the correspondence between our BOM and the stickers used
by the factory to load the feeders. See below for an example of one
sticker for one reference used on the top layer.</p>
<p><img alt="XIOHV5_PCB_STICK_EX" src="/public/XIOHv5/.P1050993_m.jpg" title="XIOHV5_PCB_STICK_EX, août 2012" /></p>
<p>Once all the components were ready and sorted out, they were ready to be
carried at the factory for loading and assembling.</p>
<p><img alt="XIOHV5_COMPONANTS_READY" src="/public/XIOHv5/.20120723_001_m.jpg" title="XIOHV5_COMPONANTS_READY, août 2012" /></p>
<p>As an automatic machine geek, the best part was the loading and
pick-and-place of the several ICs on the board. This part is quite
impressive because of the efficiency of the placing. Afterwards, the PCB
goes through an oven for 10minutes for the final soldering, then cools
down prior to the manual assembly of the through-holes components.</p>
<p>Below is a picture with the various IC packages we are using (CPU, ISDN,
FXO/FXS, micro-controllers...)</p>
<p><img alt="XIOHV5_LOADING_ICS" src="/public/XIOHv5/.20120725_005_m.jpg" title="XIOHV5_LOADING_ICS, août 2012" /></p>
<p>We then prepared the through-holes to be manually assembled by the
factory operators, with a schematic of each component in the best order
to respect the mechanical constraints.</p>
<p><img alt="XIOHV5_THROUGH_HOLES" src="/public/XIOHv5/.20120725_013_m.jpg" title="XIOHV5_THROUGH_HOLES, août 2012" /></p>
<p>The assembling of those throug-holes components can take up to 30minutes
for complex boards. It has to be checked when there are a lot of
connectors (for instance) on a board. The ready-to-test boards were then
placed on shelves for us to start our debugging.</p>
<p><img alt="XIOHV5_MOUNTING_THOLES" src="/public/XIOHv5/.20120725_012_m.jpg" title="XIOHV5_MOUNTING_THOLES, août 2012" /></p>
<p>The first batch of tests was done with 5 of the 50 PCBs in order for us
to start the debugging in our lab.</p>
<h2>Debugging the PCBs</h2>
<p>Back to our lab, we were able to start the testing our boards. We did
the following steps in-order:</p>
<ul>
<li>smoke test: testing the power-supply using current-limited power
    supplies for each voltage level, on a special board without the CPU
    assembled (in order to save one in case of short-circuit on
    the board.)</li>
<li>flashing the board with our firmwares (programming the
    power-sequence in an MSP430 and a BIOS in an SPI flash.) This
    validates the flashing method and flashing tools/cables.</li>
<li>booting-up the CPU and testing the serial console</li>
<li>RAM testing: this validates the calibration and initialization of
    the DDR2 controller by our custom firmware.</li>
<li>SATA testing: to be able to start the hard drive and the kernel
    image after the complete BIOS boot sequence</li>
<li>testing the telco interfaces and phone call features.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="XIOHV5_DEBUG_BOARD" src="/public/XIOHv5/.P1050995_m.jpg" title="XIOHV5_DEBUG_BOARD, août 2012" /></p>
<p>Above is our main whiteboard listing the issues we have on each PCB, and
how to fix those. This is the most exciting (though stressful) part of
hardware development, as we were able to make progress and get results
in a very short time. We were extastic when we got the first board fully
working with the XiVO software running on it!</p>
<h2>Final tests</h2>
<p>The rest is mainly software: we got XiVO running with our kernel drivers
and plan to do some stress testing to see how well our boards fare with
time and use.</p>
<p><img alt="XIOHV5_FULL_RUNNING" src="/public/XIOHv5/.20120802_001_m.jpg" title="XIOHV5_FULL_RUNNING, août 2012" /></p>
<h2>Next steps</h2>
<p>The next steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>finishing the production of the the first 50 PCB batch and start a
    full 4-weeks time period of stress testing on our board to identify
    potential hardware/software bugs,</li>
<li>validating the hardware and software,</li>
<li>optimizing the production process for the next batches</li>
</ul>
<p>To be continued soon...</p>

      &#8226; Tagged with
      <a href="http://blog.xivo.io/tag/xivo-12.html">xivo 1.2</a>,      <a href="http://blog.xivo.io/tag/xivo.html">xivo</a>,      <a href="http://blog.xivo.io/tag/software.html">software</a>,      <a href="http://blog.xivo.io/tag/reporting.html">reporting</a>    </p>

  <div>
      <p>One of the main feature of XiVO 1.2 is the call center reporting.</p>
<p>Motivation</p>
<p>The first draft of this new feature proved to be hard to maintain and
slow to generate statistics. Furthermore, the format of the cache (files
containing one month of statistics in JSON format) was not easy to
exploit and required more work while viewing daily statistics that would
use raw data instead of the pre generated cache for speed reasons.</p>
<p><img alt="statistic_queue.png" src="/public/.statistic_queue_m.jpg" title="statistic_queue.png, août 2012" /></p>
<p>To fix the problems we had with this first version, we decided to
rewrite the cache generation that is not dependent on statistic
configuration, avoiding the need to regenerate the cache every time a
configuration is changed.</p>
<p>The new cache format uses tables in the asterisk database to store
pre-analyzed data. These tables contains call related information (table
stat_call_on_queue) and statistic for each hours of statistic
(stat_queue_periodic).</p>
<p>This new format make it a lot faster to generate the cache and easier to
generate tables and graphics in the web interface. Using an hour as the
base time for an entry also fix the problem of overlapping time range
that we had to solve with month based cache, where a week could start in
month n and end in month n + 1.</p>
<p>Difference from the first version for the user</p>
<p>The cache is only generated for complete hours. This means that if you
generate the cache at 12h15 the cache will end at 11h59 and the next
time the cache is generated, it will start at 12h00. The cache is also
continuously generated (once a day) and since the cache is independent
of the configuration, it does not have to be generated each time a
change is made to the configuration.</p>
<p>The way to generate the cache manually at this moment is to run
xivo-stat fill_db from the command line on the XiVO. The generate cache
option of the web interface will run this action when the old cache
won't be required anymore.</p>
<p>What is done</p>
<p>Currently (version 12.14) all queue counters are now computed using the
new cache. Some errors are still shown on some page that we could not
port to the new system in time but most should be fixed in the next
version.</p>
<p>We are also working on the first agent counter that should be available
in version (12.15) and all other agents counters should be added in the
next 2 versions.</p>
<p>Some changes to the configuration are to expected when our work will be
done with the counters to reflect the new cache generation, but these
changes should be minor and all migration will be handled automatically
as usual.</p>
<p>Work methodology</p>
<p>A second aspect of this second version that was not present in the first
one is that we are also developing tools to generate calls and check the
generated statistics to avoid any regressions in future versions. This
process has been more time consuming than developing the counters
themselves but is a step to better test automation for XiVO.</p>
<p>Documentation</p>
<p>The documentation for call center statistics is
available<a href="http://documentation.xivo.fr/dev/contact_center/statistics/statistics.html" title="Call center statistics">here</a>.</p>
<p>The code</p>
<p>xivo-stat is available at git://git.xivo.fr/official/xivo-stat.git</p>
<p>xivo-callgen is available at git://git.xivo.fr/official/xivo-callgen.git</p>

      <p><strong>The current version of prototype is named XIOHv5</strong> (XiVO IPBX
OpenHardware version5) and is still developed using 10-layers BRD file
and 30+ pages of SCH (schematics) to handle the different blocks of the
design and assemble them in one PCB. <strong>We have been doing several
optimizations and features adding :</strong>-removing one DIMM of DDR2-using a
MSP430 micro-controller to handle the power-sequence (critical feature
for the boot of the CPU EP80579)-space optimization for the power supply
and connectors-changing the format of certain connectors (i.e. UART
RS232 to an RJ45 connector)</p>
<p>Please find below a screenshot of our BRD file (board file in Eagle 6.2)
showing the PCB and displaying the polygons for certain layers</p>
<p><img alt="XIOHv5-BRD-Polygons" src="/public/XIOHv5/.XIOHv5_PCB_m.jpg" title="XIOHv5-BRD-Polygons, juil. 2012" /></p>
<p>Polygons are signal, power and ground wires that assemble zone of wire
to simplify the design and have wires to handle some currents needs on
some power rails that we have. The power rails are numerous on the board
and they should respect the current level needed by each block diagram
(we will make an up-coming on the power rail organization) and namely
the SoC that carries different functionnal block such as MAC, USB, RAM,
UART, and TDM controller.</p>
<p>The design of these polygons take some times and should checked to be
sure that we don't multiply signals by making polygons of the same
signal with different names. For instance, all GND (ground) polygons
should be connected and named the same.</p>
<p>Once the board and schematics had been finalized and checked (and
double-checked), we did process FAB files for the PCB manufacturing and
below you can see the picture of our PCB on top of a stack of PCBs ready
to be assembled with the 1000+ components and 150+ different references
of parts.</p>
<p><img alt="XIOHv5-PCB-Stickers" src="/public/XIOHv5/.P1050963_m.jpg" title="XIOHv5-PCB-Stickers, juil. 2012" /></p>
<p>Prior to do the assembling in factory, we need check the package for
each of our references and do a BoM (Bill of Materials) optimization to
handle nicely our stock.</p>
