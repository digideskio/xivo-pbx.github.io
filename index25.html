      <h4>kernel-module ignores SOURCE_MODULE</h4>
<p>When the ROLE=kernel-module is set, the binary packages are built from
an existing package containing the sources of a kernel module in a
fashion that is suitable for module-assistant to work on. The kernel
module to be built is set in the MODULE= variable. If the name of the
module and the name of the package containing the sources from which it
must be built are the same, module-assistant will guess and retrieve the
package from the repository. If the package name is different, it must
be set in the SOURCE_MODULE= variable.When MODULE is different from
SOURCE_MODULE, the dependency graph generated by
lib/kernel-module/depends.sh will fail to create the dependency to the
SOURCE_MODULE package</p>
<p>The dependency was changed from depending on the rule that is used to
build the package to the timestamp generated by the build of the
package. Using the rule would always recompile the package. Using the
timestamp only recompiles of one timestamp is more recent.The regular
expression looking for the MODULE in the Makefile is changed to also
look for the SOURCE_MODULE variable. When both are found, their content
is used to lookup a source package. If it turns out that both MODULE and
SOURCE_MODULE are present and MODULE is the name of a source package,
their will be one undesired dependency. However, this is harmless
because the worst that can happen is that the kernel modules are rebuilt
although they don't need to.</p>
<p><a href="http://packaging-farm.dachary.org/trac/changeset/3c7465772c1bcb81fd508bd060cf980a7806d490">changeset</a></p>
<h4>submit-xivo.sh must reuse tarbal</h4>
<p>When the Debian GNU/Linux package of a XiVO software is improved, the
source tarbal must not be rebuilt. Rebuilding the .orig.tar.gz for the
exact same directory tree will lead to a different md5sum signature,
because of the compression. This is problematic when software building
Debian GNU/Linux repositories such as reprepro refuse a submission
because they already know of a previous tarbal of the same name but with
a different version number.</p>
<p>XiVO formerly had native Debian GNU/Linux packages (i.e. packages where
there is no separate source tarbal). It was later decided to not create
native Debian GNU/Linux packages but the code that prevented the
re-generation of the tarbal was not modified accordingly.A native
package, in the XiVO sense, has no third party code. There is a source
tree separate from the debian tree, but both are dedicated to XiVO. In
order to simplify the submission script, it was decided to avoid
handling Debian GNU/Linux native packages. Even when the source tree is
empty, the resulting package is treated as if there was a source
tree.The code is slightly different with regard to the generation of the
tarbal because the XiVO native package has a source tree including the
name of the software at the root. The third party source tree does not
contain this additional hierarchy level.</p>

<h4>reduce the number of hg pull</h4>
<p>When running packaging-farm DIRECTORY=a submit ; packaging-farm
DIRECTORY=b submit, it does a git fetch twice on the source and debian
repositories although one would be enough. When this operations is
repeated 30 times only to find that one package must be rebuild, it can
take up to 2 minutes.</p>
<p>A timestamp is set after pulling the debian and source repositories.
Before pulling, the modification time of the timestamp is checked and if
it is found to be more recent than X minutes ago ( GIT_CACHE_MINUTES
), the pull is not done. By default the value of GIT_CACHE_MINUTES is
set to zero to preserve the current behavior (i.e. the pull occurs every
time).</p>

<h4>epoch always triggers submission</h4>
<p>The epoch ( number: prepended to package version as explained in
deb-version ) does not show in the .dsc file created by
dpkg-buildpackage -SWhen submit/submit-xivo.sh looks for the .dsc file
matching the package version extracted from the debian changelog, it
does not remove the epoch. As a consequence, the package is never found
to match and is always submitted.</p>
<p>The epoch is stripped from the version before checking it against an
existing .dsc file.</p>

<h4>wanpipe</h4>
<p>The <strong>wanpipe</strong> directory is mentionned in the
<strong>/var/cache/packaging-farm/skaro/Makefile</strong> line that checks for
submissions. It is not listed as a package to be build. In order to
avoid submitting it to the farm each time a rebuild is required, it was
commented out.</p>
<h4>epoch change</h4>
<p>The migration from svn to git imposed a change in the version numbers.
It must be taken into account by incrementing the epochin the package
version, otherwise the versions will go back in time which is not good
for upgrading. The safeguards introduced insubmit-xivo.sh issue an error
for each package that has a version going back in time:</p>

      <h4>package versions</h4>
<p>The XiVO package versions are automatically generated in part and follow
the debian conventions as documented in the deb-version(1) manual page.
The automatic numbering occurs in the submit-xivo.sh script as described
below:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>VERSIONS
       The  XiVO source packages have no version information. The Debian GNU/Linux package version numbers are generated based on the date
       of the last commit in the source directory (not the debian directory), the version of the third party source if any, the content of
       the  VERSION  file  from  the  source  directory,  followed  by  the  value  of  the  VERSION_FLAVOR  variable  and its short hash.
       V.V.V+X.X.X~YYYYMMDD.HHMMSS.HASH will be the version number of a package built from the third party source version  V.V.V  for  the
       benefit  of  XiVO version X.X.X where the last commit in the sources was made on YYYYMMDD.HHMMSS. This last commit hash is appended
       to the version number.  Example: asterisk-1.4.42+1.1.15~20110312.102015.8ff428-1

       When merging a source with its matching Debian GNU/Linux package, the first line of the debian/changelog file must contain the com‐
       puted version number. If it does not, a new changelog entry is used with the following template:
              echo &quot;<span class="nv">$package</span> (<span class="cp">${</span><span class="n">version</span><span class="cp">}${</span><span class="n">debian_version</span><span class="cp">}</span>) <span class="nv">$component</span>; urgency=low&quot;
              echo
              echo &quot;  * upstream update&quot;
              echo
              echo -n &quot; -- <span class="nv">$DEBFULLNAME</span> <span class="err">&lt;</span><span class="nv">$DEBEMAIL</span>&gt;  &quot;
              date &#39;+%a, %d %b %Y %R:%S %z&#39;
              echo

       The  handling  of  the versions for the packages that have no corresponding source such as pf-xivo or pf-xivo-backup is simpler and
       relies on the version found in the VERSION file of the source directory only.
</pre></div>


<p>The XiVO developers were used to a tool that also incremented the Debian
GNU/Linux version. It is no longer the case and instead of having a -0
version number the developer is required to take care of the increment
as any Debian GNU/Linux package would.This created a confusion that led
to inconsistencies in the sequence of the package versions. Because the
submit-xivo.sh script was unable to detect and properly report these
inconsistencies, it created a situation that was very confusing.To avoid
such troubles, a number of safeguards <a href="http://packaging-farm.dachary.org/trac/changeset/bd8626b5f1d43677f9d3ce5990fb4a545a1982e6">were
implemented</a>
to properly document the following mistakes:</p>
<ul>
<li>a changelog with a mismatched package name</li>
<li>a missing version</li>
<li>a native package (submit-xivo.sh requires non native packages)</li>
<li>a package version that goes back in time</li>
</ul>
<h4>verbosity</h4>
<p>The packaging-farm script is based on make(1) which is very verbose by
default. The amount of information produced is useful for debugging but
confusing to the developer. The default was <a href="http://packaging-farm.dachary.org/trac/changeset/5c7ce86716fc16c5ad58910f4c973b081b4a6280">set to
quiet</a>
and can be reverted to verbose as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>QUIET=&#39;&#39; packaging-farm target
</pre></div>


<p>This was not documented as it is only useful to debug packaging-farm
itself.</p>

      <h4>multiuser locking</h4>
<p>The packaging-farm command does not behave well when two are run
simultaneously to build the same package. Nothing bad happens but fixing
the result involves umounting a number of aufs corrupted file systems
and it is inconvenient. To avoid this, the packaging-farm command was
<a href="http://packaging-farm.dachary.org/trac/changeset/8855a9c5fc09b088edaa055a33de1e820f30cc42">modified to set a lock based on the last
argument</a>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>When packaging-farm is run, a lock is set on  its  last  argument.  For
       instance,

              packaging-farm asterisk

       will  set a lock on /var/lock/packaging-farm/asterisk and another invo-
       cation of the same command while this one is still  running  will  wait
       for the first command to finish. Unless the command completes on error,
       the second invocation will just echo that  nothing  needs  to  be  done
       because the previous command did all the work.

       If the command

              packaging-farm gallifrey

       is  run  and that the gallifrey package depends on the asterisk package
       and needs to build it, the same mechanism will be used.  For  instance,
       if  user  A runs packaging-farm gallifrey after user B started to build
       packaging-farm asterisk, the higher level command gallifrey will  pause
       until asterisk has finished building and then resume.
</pre></div>


<h4>multiple builds of the same version</h4>
<p>It was possible to build the same version of a given version of a
package multiple times. While this comes handy in some cases, it is
confusing in general. The user has to remember that a --reinstall is
required to get the latest version. The reprepro(1) tool refuses the new
package because it has a different checksum than the previous one. A
<a href="http://packaging-farm.dachary.org/trac/changeset/893a93e8a352b1cf0739d325603dc8d3eef38d13">+build prefix was
appended</a>
to avoid this confusion.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>REBUILDING PACKAGES AND PUBLISHING REPOSITORIES
       packaging-farm  allows  to  rebuild  the same version of a package. For
       instance, let say foo-1.2 was built and was made available,  either  as
       part  of  the package specific repository created with dpkg-scanpackage
       or as part of a meta package repository created with reprepro(1) A user
       then installs the package using

              apt-get update
              apt-get install foo

       At  this  point  in  time,  the  developer of foo finds a minor bug and
       rebuilds the package on packaging-farm  without  changing  the  version
       number.   packaging-farm  allows  the developer to do that, in the same
       way pbuilder or sbuild does. However, contrary to these tools,  packag-
       ing-farm  publishes the packages and provides a safeguard to avoid pub-
       lishing the same package version multiple times.

       If version 1.0-1 of a package is built and no previous version has been
       built,  nothing is done. If version 1.0-1 has already been built and is
       rebuilt because a package it depends on has been  upgraded,  packaging-
       farm  will add the +build1 suffix to the package version and it will be
       1.0-1+build1 In all further builds of the same version, the last number
       will be incremented as in 1.0-1+build2 If a new version of the package,
       say 1.1-1 is published, it will be compared to the last  built  version
       using dpkg --compare-version Because it is found to be greater, it will
       be used as if there was no previous build.

      <h4>conditional update based on version instead of time</h4>
<p>The following use case fails if <strong>submit-xivo.sh</strong> does not create a
source package if the timestamp of the last successfull build is more
recent than the latest commit of the debian or source repository.</p>
<ul>
<li>DIRECTORY=package submit-xivo.sh</li>
<li>checkout a tag set a day before</li>
<li>DIRECTORY=package submit-xivo.sh</li>
</ul>
<p>This problem was introduced with the implementation of the GIT_REVISION
variable that allows to chose which tag or branch the debian and source
should be set.Instead of checking for the build timestamp, the version
of the package that should be build is checked against an existing
.diff.gz file in the source directory. If no match is found, the source
package is created.The documentation was updated to reflect this new
behavior:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>When run as DIRECTORY=asterisk submit.xivo.sh will merge  the  asterisk
       sources  with  the  corresponding Debian GNU/Linux package instructions
       and build a source package.


       step 1 - update the git repositories
              the SOURCE_GIT and DEBIAN_GIT repositories  are  pulled  in  the
              VCS_DIR directory.

       step 2 - test dependencies
              if  there exists a .diff.gz file matching the current version of
              the package (see VERSION below), skip step 3 and step 4

       step 3 - merge sources and Debian GNU/Linux package
              the source  and  Debian  package  information  are  copied  from
              VCS_DIR and merged into PACKAGES_DIR

       step 4 - build source package
              without  any attempt at resolving dependencies, a source package
              is built using dpkg-buildpackage
</pre></div>


<h4>VERSION_FLAVOR</h4>
<p>At the request of Nicolas Hicher, the VERSION_FLAVOR variable was added
to implement the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>VERSIONS
       The XiVO source  packages  have  no  version  information.  The  Debian
       GNU/Linux  package  version  numbers are generated based on the date of
       the last commit in the source directory (not the debian directory), the
       version  of  the  third party source if any, the content of the VERSION
       file from the source directory, followed  by  the  value  of  the  VER-
       SION_FLAVOR   variable   and   its   short   hash.   V.V.V+X.X.X~YYYYM-
